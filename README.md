# REDDIT DATA PROJECT 🚀

A personal data science project exploring Reddit content and user behavior patterns, with a focus on cognitive, psychological, and social insights.

## 🧠 Project Goal

This project aims to simulate a full data science workflow from raw data collection to analysis and interpretation. It focuses on Reddit posts (e.g., from r/depression, r/mentalhealth, etc.) and seeks to explore:

- Behavioral features (e.g., posting frequency, timing)
- Textual content (themes, word usage, sentiment)
- Engagement metrics (votes, comments)
- Mental health signals from language
