doqwow,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2361,177,1572360722.0,depression,SQLwitch,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,2025-07-25T09:58:02.422990
1jys8x9,"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",42,110,1744611968.0,depression,SQLwitch,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jys8x9/regular_checkin_post_with_essential_information/,2025-07-25T09:58:02.422990

Hi everyone I hope this is the right place for this. My girlfriend has lived with Major Depressive Disorder since she was younger and I’m trying to learn how to be a better partner for her.  I want to be clear, I’m not tryna  “fix” her or be the superman here. I just want to support her better, especially with mood swings or low moments. Right now we cope by spending time together like watching cartoons until we fall asleep but I can always sense something brewing underneath the surface. She doesn’t like talking about her own emotions and can be prone to spirals so I’ve adjusted my focus on just being a steady partner rather than pushing her to talk. I know MDD isn’t something that goes away by talking about it but I’d love to hear firsthand from others who have experienced MDD and all of its facets.

I have a date picked out. I took a week of vacation soon and I’m planning on getting a hotel room so no one who knows me has to see anything. I’m planning on calling 911 myself while it’s happening so hopefully only first responders see anything.

I’ve reached out to people. I’ve told people, seriously and jokingly. I keep telling people that I’m going to miss them but they think it’s just because I’m changing positions at work. I keep telling people that I’m getting bad… that my mental state isn’t okay and I’m not okay but they just don’t seem to understand.

I’ve even went as far as to make sure certain people know that no matter what I do nothing is their fault but no one takes me seriously. I’m not sure what I have to do to get anyone to notice. Or maybe it’s just showing me that I’m making the right plans because no one cares.

But I’m here. Right now. Telling a bunch of strangers on Reddit in hopes that someone will try to talk me out of it, or give me hope that it’ll get better.

1m8e0wo,What if your depressive thoughts are actually true,"So as I understand it, treatments for depression often centre around the thoughts that come along with depression (I'm unlikable, I'm worthless, I'm no good at anything) being untrue, and therefore your depression will improve if you can recognize this and think more accurately. That's all well and fine if that's the case, but what if my depressive thoughts are true? 

Like I truly genuinely believe I'm not that likable. It's been the case my whole life. I've always been the person no one really wants to be friends with or close with; people are happy to be cordial and friendly but I'm just not that likable. People dont want to be around me a lot or be close to me. It's happened in literally every environment I've ever been in: school, university, extracurricular groups, different workplaces, with extended family, in mom's groups etc. It's so hard to see others only interested in getting to know and befriend other people. 

I also genuinely believe I'm not worth much. I have basically no talents at all. Everyone else seems to have so much they're good at, so much to offer and give, why was I not gifted with anything? I feel I have nothing to offer. It's so hard seeing other people who are so smart, talented, good looking, successful... And I'm none of that. 

I feel like I've looked at this objectively as I can. I'm not being over dramatic but really feel like it is the case that I'm unlikable and not worth much. So if the thoughts are true and inherently lead to depression... Is there any hope for me? Or does it just make sense to be depressed because my life is and likely always will be depressing?

1m8j0if,I used to be alive. Now I’m just existing.,"I’m 27, and I feel like my life has already ended. I’m just dragging out what’s left of it until I hit the deadline I gave myself which is age 30. If things don’t change by then, I’m done. I’ve made peace with that.

There was a time I actually lived. I had friends I loved, nights full of laughter, hours lost in games that made me feel connected, present, human. I used to have goals. I cared about things. I was excited to wake up. I was curious about the world and my place in it.

Now there’s nothing. I’ve lost everyone. The people I used to be close with have vanished. The things that brought me joy feel dead. I try to play games and I just sit there, empty. Music doesn’t move me. I barely eat. I barely sleep. I barely feel.

Every day blends into the next. I watch time pass, but I’m not really in it. Just surviving out of habit.

I set 30 as the point where if nothing changes, I walk away from it all. Three years left. And honestly? I don’t see anything getting better. I think I already know how this ends.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe just to mark the fact that I was here, that I used to be someone.

1m8sp3q,I feel so stupid,"I'm a 17f and at this point I don't know what's wrong with me anymore. Something is, something is definitely wrong but I don't know what it is. On the other hand though I feel like it's just all in my head and I'm trying to compensate for being lazy while doing absolutely nothing with my life. But it's not okay, I know that what I'm doing isn't okay. I don't do anything with myself. I spend my entire day laying in my bed in a dark room, watching TV, sleeping the day away and doom scrolling. 

I don't keep up with hygiene regularly. I don't change my clothes for weeks on end or even put my clothes in the laundry, I don't even remember the last time I brushed my teeth, I either don't eat at all in a day or eat everything in sight, the only thing I've really been keeping up with is showering and that's only because when my hair gets the slightest bit greasy I feel uglier than I already do and it makes me just sob because of how disgusting I am. I also hate the feeling of greasy hair on my neck. 


There's this one part of my brain that knows I'm screwing up in every aspect of everything and it just keeps telling me to cut it out and get off my ass so I can actually make something of myself. Then there's the other side that just doesn't care about anything. I want to care, but I just don't. I don't care about anything and I hate it so much. I'm turning 18 in 5 months and my senior year is right around the corner and still I just don't give a fuck about anything. Everything just feels so pointless all of the time and I just feel so stupid. I feel stupid for even posting on this subreddit.

Like what am I even doing? I'm a complete failure and as much as I know I really need to start doing what I need to do to get my life back on track after years of stewimg in my own self-loathing, I don't. Everything feels to exhausting all the time and if I could, I'd burry myself in a deep hole underground and just stay there sleeping till the end of everything. Nothing feels good and I feel like such a piece of shit for even thinking that there's something wrong with me instead of just excepting the fact that I'm just a horrible, revpulsive, lazy sorry excuse for a human being that is better off in a ditch somewhere. 

I'm going nowhere in life and it feels like the world is crashing down on me and I still just don't care. Everything is just running an infinite circles over and over again until something inevitably happens to me. Like some weird infinity looped train track. I just don't know where I went wrong. I hate myself. I hate myself so much and I wish that everything would just stop already. And that's the funniest part too because I have no reason to feel like this and yet I do. I just do.

The worst part is even in summer school I'm failing. Yeah, SUMMER SCHOOL. I know, how pathetic. Nothing has ever felt right, I don't feel right and I don't think that I ever will feel right. Sometimes I wish I was just dead, I'm too scared to do anything myself and I hate it. Not only do I refuse to do anything at all, I also happen to be too scared to just do everyone a favor and take care of the problem already by jumping off of a bridge. One day, sometime soon I hope something happens to me. I hope I just get hit by a car while crossing the street and die on impact or die of nicotine poisoning or something. 

None of it feels like it will ever get better and I just feel so stupid. I feel some stupid, pathetic, lazy, low life, who's just getting her hormones mixed up with real problems. I'm so stupid and I hate myself so much. I hate being stuck with myself, I hate that I wake up and still remain me.

I've been distancing myself and pushing people away, isolating myself, for awhile now knowing what I was planning to do so it would hurt them less, and because I'd made up my mind I wanted to do this so I wasn't doing anything that would be good for me like going outside and socialising because I didn't want to change my mind. 

Now what do I do? I've just been drifting, not moving forward, not planning anything. I don't want to be alive but I can't leave. 

My counsellor dropped me two weeks ago because she didn't feel qualified to deal with me since my mental health is so poor, so she said she'd refer me on to a more experienced counsellor.

She’s moved on, focusing on her career, and I truly respect that… but my heart still holds on, still waits for her to come back. I miss her deeply her presence, the little things.

Football used to be my escape whenever I felt low, but even that seems to be slipping away. I haven’t been able to play properly, and my recent mistake even cost my team the game.

There’s stress at work too, and to be honest, I’ve just been bottling everything up. I don’t talk to my family about any of this because I don’t want to make them feel sad or worried.

1m8jpyk,sad girl,"37/f in a major US city. Life has felt flat for a long time. The last time I remember anything good happening to me was 2022, so a solid 3 years has passed of just the same shit day in, day out. I have pockets of time where I commit hard to making my life better (getting a gym routine, getting a new hobby, etc) but the past few years have seen a lot of hardship for me (difficult medical diagnoses, breakups, friend breakups, family deaths, pet deaths, etc) and I always end up feeling like I'm right back where I started.

It is getting harder to see what the point of any of it is. I want to believe the point is love - not necessarily romantic, though that would be nice. But love for animals, love for friends, love for humanity. But life circumstances have left me pretty isolated. Dysfunctional family, very few friends (really like, one friend if I'm being honest), no romantic prospects. It has been a long time since I've felt chosen by anyone. (""You have to choose yourself"" - yeah, I get it, but I am tired of doing all of life things alone. Traveling alone, going on ""dates"" alone.

Everyone at work thinks I'm well off and every time my card declines they just laugh and say oh I guess that purchase was declined for one reason or another.

She’s upping my antidepressants to the therapeutical dosage and also prescribing me sleep meds until my depression symptoms are at a minimum. Right now I maybe average 5-6 hours of broken sleep, and I’ve been doing this for years. I wake up every hour or so. The only place I’ve ever been able to sleep soundly was at my ex boyfriend’s house, I really miss that sleep and having him next to me. 

I went out with one of my closest friends after my appointment. We walked around the mall, bought new jewelry for my piercings, then headed over to the book store. I love hanging out with her because she’s a big talker and I’m really not. She doesn’t make me feel bad for being quiet and just keeps talking which I appreciate. We talked about everything, even though we do that just about every day. I’m glad I have her. I’m almost old enough to be her mom but we get along great and always have so much fun. 

We have another outing next week to do something she’s never done and I’m kind of excited about it. It’s a creative type of outing and I think she’s gonna have a lot of fun with it.

1m8t1ef,Do I have some psychological disorder?,"I have a question about myself, and I'm not even sure if it's valid. Over a month ago, I took an important university entrance exam but didn't get good results. For a few days after that, I had thoughts of suicide. Especially on the night the results came out, I almost actually committed suicide. Since 8th grade, I've struggled to make friends, and no matter what I do or where I go, I feel very lonely and hurt. Even when people say or do small things, they affect me deeply. So when I entered high school, it became even harder to make friends. I dislike talking and socializing, just wanting to stay home without going anywhere. Even though I can communicate quite well. I seem to hate everything and only want to stay alone in my room. But after the university exam, my excessive sensitivity and overthinking became extreme. Whenever anything slightly bad happens, I blame myself for it. I've also started fearing communication and meeting people. I'm becoming increasingly insecure. For example, when I took on tutoring 5 students and 2 missed the first class, I immediately became scared and thought they must have quit because they realized I'm incompetent. In the next session after teaching, when I saw their slightly tense expressions, I felt scared again and my insecurity intensified.

No trauma, loving parents, I have a happy relationship with a girl, lots of friends and have found a job making good money.

But at some point in the gym I was hit with these intense thoughts of how pointless my life is and feelings of crippling depression out of nowhere. I had to leave and spent the entire car ride home bawling my eyes out (i havent cried in months). Seeing my girlfriend that night was the only time I felt better.

1m8sf4n,I no longer find magic in the mundane,"I thought I was getting better. I’ve been on a good medicine routine for a while. Life was doing good. I’ve built a nice little space for myself in this effed up world. I’ve gotten a small community. I’ve put down roots. But this year has been one of the worst of my life. 

I still have a drive to do things I love, but it feels like such an effort or just stubbornness and there’s many days that I don’t do those things because I’m terrified of messing it all up. 

The worst part is I was finally seeing the good bits. A year ago, I could spend time with someone or be outside for awhile and the smallest things would make me smile. Seeing a big. Someone sending me a meme or video. Enjoying the taste of a drink or dish. But now, it’s like none of that ever happened. Now, it feels like I’m just going through the motions again. I don’t enjoy any of my hobbies. I’m forcing myself to do them in hopes that it helps keep me from rock bottom but it feels like a lie. None of it seems fun anymore. 

And maybe it’s just the depression but it feels like no one even understands. It feels like no one will even let me talk about it. 

I’ve felt this before. I swore I would never let it happen again. I was a zombie then. I was just a husk of a human being. I was going through the motions but there were no emotions. Back then, I cut myself just to make sure I could still feel something. But I haven’t done that for more than a decade. I can’t go back to that. I’d rather just stop existing entirely. 

If I can’t find the magic in the small things then how can I see the good things that are bigger? How can I keep going when I can’t even share how I’m feeling? When no one wants to support me through this?

1m7r0tj,I unfortunately survived,"I jumped of a bridge onto oncoming traffic last year in November. I somehow survived, broke many bones and also cracked my skull. I was in hospital for 2 months and since leaving I’ve been having physiotherapy and hydrotherapy, as well as constant appointments with a psychologist. I somehow managed to survived without losing anything, the surgeons considered amputating my legs but somehow managed to put it together after a 12 hour operation. I’ve been off my crutches for the last 2 months and slowly been getting my strength back. When im at physiotherapy and I see other patients missing a leg or an arm I do feel grateful that I survived without losing anything. However lately Im not sure how I feel anymore. Had another surgery to remove a metal plate and screws from my leg on Monday, university also started on Monday so ive been doing my work at home while in constant pain. As I slowly get back to my regular life im also started to feel the same as before, depressed, unmotivated, dead inside. Staying in hospital was surprisingly fun, no responsibilities, just in bed all day watching tv or scrolling on my phone, with some lovely nurses looking after me and treating me like a little brother. But now that im back home I feel lonely again, depressed, and my toxic mum aint helping either. I hoped that after realising how depressed I truly was that she may change the way she treated me but she is slowly returning to the past.

I was in depression for more than 5 years (want to die and tried to die this much depression) lastly for a year I  started to feel a heaviness in heart feeling
Most of the day I  have that feeling

Also I always do a lot of self blame and ask sorry for everything even if it is not my mistake and forget things a lot I tried to stop but couldn't 

Also my weight started to increase in the lot and stopped at 93 and what ever I  do only reduces 5 kg maximum and again increases to 93
And I couldn't sleep at night and even though I have full body pain and feel sleepy and couldn't cry anymore even though that feels like crying and sometimes I  feel like eating and sometimes don't

And also couldn't focus on things
Like couldn't force on reading more then 3 to 5 minutes unless of pressed
Even after the pressure couldn't force more than 10 minutes and always think about past things happened and lots of insecurity
Also I like to create situations in my head like what if I choose this rather than that what will my be or what could have been my life is I was with that person or never born so on or even a life which I could have lived",2,0,1753409771.0,depression,Senior-Capital-2588,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m8n96v/what_stage_of_depression_im_in_guys_and_what/,2025-07-25T09:58:02.423987

1m8q3kg,struggling with grief and spiraling,"This is my first post in here, I’ve been struggling with my grandmas death and my dogs death. I’ve been struggling with other things too. My grandma passed away May 26th, at exactly 7 am. My dog passed away June 27th 12-1 am I’m not sure at what time I just knew it was early morning. I watched them both die and take their final breaths, I watched my grandma suffered for a month and half and earlier with her health conditions. I watched my healthy dog struggle and have a seizure and having to make the choice to put him down. My mom and my older brother saw them take their final moments too, I feel so bad for them. Especially for my mom who’s an orphan, lost my grandpa in October of 2017. My grandma who passed away recently. I feel bad for my brother whose 19 now to who my mom kicked out at 18 (probably another story for another time) who has to go to back to work and act like nothing happened in order to pay for rent and food on his plate while my mom gets to have some time off of work for grief purposes. She has went back a bit ago though. 

Maybe I’ll make another post to go in more detail about the stories behind them both. I’m not sure if anyone wants to know about that.

I’ve been spiraling and spiraling for awhile now, my sleep schedule is messed up. I oversleep or under sleep, have nightmares and have problems staying asleep or going back asleep. I either overeat with stress eating or undereat thinking I don’t deserve food thinking it’s my fault that they’ve died. I take 2-3 days to shower, use mouthwash instead of brushing my teeth and wear the same clothes  or shower everyday, brush my teeth daily and scrub my body clean. Wear a change of clothes everyday and wash my bedding. Be all productive with my to do lists and chores around the house. Going outside on walks, spending time with my family or boyfriend or friends. Or I’m all in bed all day or on the couch just scrolling and scrolling or watching tv. I have panic attacks 2-3 times a day usually (over different reasons and this too) or mental breakdowns and just cry and cry. I zone out for a long time, I feel like I’m not real at times. I experience so much emotions at once , frustration, sadness. Hopelessness, relief, fear and emptiness. Guiltiness, pity in my stomach, wanting them back but they’re not going to come back. I have mood swings like getting all sad and depressed then I’m all happy and motivated, dancing around my room or doing what I said above. I have anger too but that’s not too often it’s just either sad or happy or neutral. 

I drink from time to time not too often since I’m not really supposed to, and I don’t want my parents or others pissed off at me. I used to cut myself but I have urges to do that but I don’t. I think about taking my own life but I don’t, the main reasons that I was living was my grandma and my dog. I’ve thought about writing a suicide note and going by the train tracks by my house, or drowning myself in the tub but I can’t do that. Of course my other loved ones too are the reasons why I’m living but those were the main ones.

I’ve been talking to my mom mostly and my boyfriend and some of my friends about how I feel and everything. I try to journal or draw out my feelings and what’s going on but I feel like I can’t really express them how I want to or doesn’t come across the way that it did in my head if that makes any sense. I try not too do it to much because I don’t want to feel like a nuance and don’t want them to turn into therapist friends and I appreciate them being there for me. I really do. I can’t really tell my mom all of my feelings with the cutting and suicide stuff. 

My parents mocked me for my anxiety and other issues, when they did found out about my cutting didn’t really handle it well. Dangled a carrot in front of my head for years and years saying that they’ll give me help no matter the cost, no matter if it gets in the way of their work schedules that they’ll find a way to help me and promised to do so in order to improve my situation. When I asked about it or just wanting therapy as a Christmas gift for years and years. They said that I’m not that crazy, that they’ll have to pay out of pocket for it and can’t afford it. That it’s ridiculous that I’m wanting therapy as a Christmas gift or wanting an update on what they promised. That my cutting was just a phase that I went through, my anxiety wasn’t and isn’t that bad 
( I used to be medicated and it has gotten way way worse). That I’m not depressed I’m just growing, have to get over things. This would mess with my brain, and then they would ask again to me if I needed therapy and help. And I would say no and deny that I don’t need it, that I’m fine in order to make them happy. Then, I would ask again later on and they would say oh well you said you didn’t need it when I did need it and do need it. 

That’s why I can’t really get therapy, I probably have to wait until I move out. I know it might help me and everything, could improve my panic attacks and mental breakdowns. I want to stop feeling this way and stop this spiraling but it’s difficult because I find comfort in the spiral though it’s harming me at the same time but I’m going through harm either way. I just miss them both and don’t get why I have to go through so much at so young. I’ll probably sleep on the chair in the living room and can’t shower since I’m so exhausted. Maybe there’s a reason, I don’t know why Im going to post this in here for anyone to read and listen to me. Or give me advice or insult me or anything.

1m8pvbt,Hi I'm Iya and I want to be better,"I managed to live to my adulthood without a hitch. I thought I was strong and happy. I never flunked a class or even skipped a single one. My grades have always been good. I thought I can do it. But then I realized that I have been fooling myself. I have bottled up everything and now it's exploding on my adulthood. 

  
My first attempt was when I was 16. I was holding the knife in my hand when my friend talked me out of it. She stayed with me for hours till I passed out from crying. I have wrote countless of suicide notes and even started a diary. I want my family to my pain. I want them to know that when I die, that they're one of the reasons why. I want them to hurt like me whenever they use me as an outlet for their own depression and pain. How it hurts whenever my other family member ask me to be understanding. I wasn't that destructive when I was depressed. They don't know how many times they have almost lost me. They don't know that whenever I sleep at night, I sincerely pray to the man upstairs, if they even exist, to just end my pain and take me. Afterall, I think it would be beneficial to me and my family. 

  
My coping mechanism has always been self-destructive. I never shout or hurt other people like they do with me. Hell, they didn't even know one of my uncles touched me when I was 14 and almost raped me if I didn't run away. That was the memory that broke me and started all these spiral. My memory is so fckng blurry these days. Sometimes I myself at night thinking what If something really happened and I wasn't able to open the door and run? What if my brain is just protecting me from the bad memories? I never understood why I had crippling fear towards men with tall stature after I woke up from a nightmare about it. I thought I was just not used to it since my father was abroad on the entirety of my childhood. I hate male figures. I hate male authority. I hate masc perfumes. I hate everything about men but at the same time I am desperate for someone that can prove me wrong. That the men in my life won't always hurt me or take advantage of me. I want to see the good in people. 

  
My ""perfect"" childhood is shattered and more horrible memories are surfacing up. I am now a mess. I haven't looked for a job or did something worthwhile. I want the structure and purpose that used to distract me from all my pain. I have lost interest in the things I find exciting before. I tried my best to find the silver lining, but it feels like there's a quagmire of hands always pulling me down. Like there's a rope around my neck just waiting for me to finally jump down.

  
I am Iya and I want to be better. Aside from Meds and Therapy, what do you all do to move on and have a functional day? I have tried journaling but I always end up writing my Suicide notes.

1m8cp2s,Wanting to be alive doesn't make any sense,"I feel like there's an absurdity to being alive, and wanting to live as long as possible. To live is to lose everything you ever cared about. If you live too long, you lose friends, family, innocence, control of your body, and even your own identity ten times over. No matter what you do, there will always be a point where life takes away more than it gives. But everyone wants to eke out as much life as we can. Life is like a drug that we've all grown dependent on, no matter how much it destroys us. Even I'm dependent on it. I'm too afraid of the alternative. But being alive has ruined me. There was a happy, optimistic kid who used to live within me. But since he took his first breath, he's had friends and family stolen from him, he's had his dreams and aspirations mangled before his eyes, his self esteem crushed, his mind broken, he's been taken advantage of, belittled, assaulted, and betrayed; his only gifts from life have been constant dread, a disdain for the world around him, and a complete loss of hope for the future. Life has mutilated and broken this child, but kept him awake and aware, so the torture may be prolonged. And he's far from alone in this; his story isn't even among the cruelest in the world - it isn't even close. But why would I ever want more of this?

I don’t know how to explain it but I wake up at 6am and after actually waking up, I feel good and even at times pretty great. But when it turns 8/9pm every night, caffeine no caffeine it doesn’t really matter (but alcohol does exaggerate it, hence why I pretty much quit drinking) I become severely depressed to the point where I worry about myself. I reached out to mom who’s a psychologist but she’s never heard of this happening. She deals with chronic pain as a specialty so maybe it’s just not prevalent in that population? 

I don’t know. I guess I’m asking for any tips any advice even just any “yeah that happens to me too but I have no advice” would be nice.

1m869o1,Some people heal quietly. Others talk about it over and over. Both are valid.,"I’ve been struggling with how people react to me sharing about my experience. I’m still going through a legal situation related to my mental health and being fired, and I use posting as part of how I process it. But lately I’ve been criticized for posting about it too often.

People assume I’m just looking for attention, but this is genuinely how I cope. It’s not about karma or likes. This is deeply personal, and I wish more people understood that not everyone heals in silence. Some of us talk. Some of us repeat ourselves. That doesn’t make it less valid.

I’ve been feeling really discouraged and I’m just wondering… has anyone else felt this kind of judgment when trying to talk about your mental health? How do you deal with that?

Hi, this is my first post but I have been reading tattoo regret threads for a few weeks now. I am in my mid thirties, female and come from a conservative family. I have tattoos from a decade ago but they were all in discrete places and fairly small. I have always admired upper arm/ sleeve tattoos and it was on my bucket list to def get one. I got a large but intricate black line work on my upper arm all the way up to my shoulder about 3 weeks ago, and a week into it, I started regretting getting the tattoo there at all. I’ve been researching ways to cover it up with makeup/ tricks and tips on how to hide it when I have to go out. Don’t get me wrong, I love the artist’s work, he didn’t do anything wrong but the sight of it and the thought of it on my body makes me so anxious that it’s all I think about/ doom scroll about. Not proud of it, but I’m not eating or sleeping and I’m constantly anxious. I’m so ashamed of how others will perceive me when they see it and it’s making me hate all the other tiny ink on my body. I just need my body to be “clean” again.

1m8oez6,Im having a depressive episode and i just feel so alone,"This post is mainly just me venting cause im just kinda feeling a bit shit right now. I have a hard time putting my feelings into words but i’ll do my best. These feelings of loneliness have followed me on and off for a very long time. I dont really know what exactly is triggering it but if i had to guess it stems from how i grew up. My parents didnt really pay any attention to me growing up, my older and my younger sibling were always more important than me so when it came to prioritizing things i always drew the shortest straw. it made me feel that i were not good enough, that i were invisible and just being an afterthought. 

To compensate for the lack of attention from my family i guess i just sought it from my friends instead and when my friends make plans with each other but leave me out of it i guess it just makes me feel the same way my family makes me feel and it makes me start spiraling down and i have such a hard time getting back up again.

The worst thing about it is that i feel guilty about the feelings im feeling because they have all the right to make plans together, it shouldnt be any of my business, but atleast im handling it better now than when i were younger. I used to test my friends by not speaking to them until they reach out to me first, last time i did that somewhere around half a year to a year had passed until i finally were invited to a birthday party. At that point i had already hit rock bottom, that whole time i was locked in my room, not speaking a word to anyone. That whole period is still affecting me today, im no longer as fluent in my speech, my vocabulary isnt as good as it used to be and i have it harder articulating my words. 

Its safe to say i dont test my friends like that anymore, its really counterproductive to try solve your loneliness by isolating yourself. 

I want to talk to my friends about these feelings but im not good at expressing myself and i dont want it coming across as me trying to blame them for how im feeling because that is not the case at all. and even if they would understand me and decide to try include me more because of it id start feeling like a burden instead, its like i cant win. i guess that is all i wanted to vent",1,0,1753413257.0,depression,sunxel,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m8oez6/im_having_a_depressive_episode_and_i_just_feel_so/,2025-07-25T09:58:03.833442

I'm just tired of dealing with dumbasses.

The thing that bother me today was an argument about wolf culls in my country. The opposing argument (and yes, I'm going to over simplify it) essentially boiled down to the idea that nature can't exist without human intervention, and if we didn't go around brutalizing majestic creatures for sport, that the entire ecosystem would collapse and wolves would end up hunting humans.

It made me remember this dumbass who went around the ONE, tiny remaining truly natural area near my city and killed all of the old vines which grew over small scrubby trees and made really wonderfull looking tunnels of leaves in the summer. Dumbass happened to cross my path one day as I was casting a withering look at the base and old vine which had been cut, and he got all defensive and said ""well, what? you think the vines are more important than the trees. FML YES BECAUSE NATURE NEVER HAS AND COULD NEVER EXIST WITHOUT HUMANS FUCKING AROUND. The vine is native to the area. It's a beautiful vine. Who the fuck do humans, with their retarded morals, think they are to decide what lives and what dies. 

God. Is there some way to get away from retards?

And, look, yes, I understand that because humans have fucked the environment and destroyed a huge percentage of the world's forests that maybe there can be an argument for control animal populations. The answer to human fuckery is more human fuckery. I get it. And we'll fuck around until there's nothing left probably. 

Fuck me though. At this point I'll probably end up with the most apathetic reaction possible as the nukes rain down or as the extinction event meteor pierces the sky.

I’m pretty sure my irl friends don’t even like talking to me but I can’t really tell they don’t invite me to stuff a lot of the time but I can’t make anymore friends because I got bullied a lot(4 times) so it’d be practically impossible. I once bottled my emotions up for so long from my mum and myself that I disassociated myself from life and became numb and then one day I just broke down in her arms. I cried for so long but the day after it seemed like she just forgot about me. I wish I had a dad to speak to about my stuff but I don’t even have one he died before I could remember his face. And the worst of it all is that I just can’t cry I just feel complete sadness. The only time I don’t is when I talk to my only online friend, he’s like the only person who’s nice to me or at least talks to me. He makes me feel special I love talking to him, but I just have a feeling that he’ll ditch me like my previous online friends who barely ever talk to me now. I don’t even feel lonely because I know I can speak to people but I don’t even know who I don’t think anyone of my online friends would want to hear how sad I can be, sometimes it just feels pointless. I hope one day I can JUST hug someone and cry until I fall asleep warm and next to someone who loves me for me.

1m8h96k,...i don't even know how to continue,"Saturday I (32f) decided to kill myself. I have been in a bad space of mind for a very long time...last year I started a vocational restraining in IT. As a single mom of 3 I wanted to be a good example and was looking to make a better future for them. I had good grades and I was studying hard. I failed. I had a crush on my classmate, (stupid of me to think that anyone would have real interest in me) what was supposed to be a simple hookup turned into assault, I tried to stop him but he was stronger than me so I just shut up. I didn't say anything because of fear and extreme shame. The day after the assault he went on to try and humiliate me by writing in the school chat group that he was going to get his blood tested (classic micro aggressions for being black in EU) 
I used alcohol and weed to numb the pain for a year, that sent me into a psychosis where I was convinced I might really have something. 
I couldn't sleep, eat, drink or even watch my comfort show. 

I woke up on Saturday checked my girls in their room kissed them and then went into my room, wrote notes and swallowed 12 pills (quietapin) injected 20 UE insulin and went back to bed. 
My brother found me right before I started having a convulsion and called 911.

I'm alive and well but now the feelings that I tried to suppress for so long are slowly coming back...i am not ready to face it or any of the other feelings. I feel so broken inside. 
I had to quit school because of all this and now all the plans I had for my girls are fucked. 
My life is just a series of depressing events... 
I'm sorry for my English.

I’ve always really hated my father but he recently got some spinal surgery done and has been in a bad mood since (though he’s always in an angry mood), and that’s just upped my hate towards him even more. I think he’s aware I really hate him, or more specifically my sisters. Both of them are older than me and I also hate them just as much as my dad, but they share the same hatred as I do towards our dad, so I feel a little less angry with them. I’ve always felt neutral about my mother. My sisters are really fond of her, but I can’t seem to ‘love’ her in the sense my sisters do. I just kind of see her as my caregiver and parent. Obviously I show her gratitude and spend time with her but again, I just can’t seem to love her. She hasn’t committed any kind of act that was particularly rude or poor-parent-like to me, ignoring the occasional mess up, but recently I just really wanna kill her. I don’t hate her, I just want her dead. I know those are kind of contradicting, I just hope you kinda get what I mean there. My oldest sister keeps telling me her plans to kill our entire family with a gun, and also shoot her school up, and to be frank it’s starting to annoy me. My other older sister keeps trying to kill herself and overdose on my dad’s medication, and it’s also starting to annoy me. I also have an older brother but he’s since been kind of independent and I don’t really talk to him much, but from what little conversation we have, I can still come to a consensus that I want his throat slit and in the ground. I think I’m really going to kill them all soon, please any advice on why I may be thinking like this or what to do are open.

1m8kuab,stuck in place,"hello again, unfortunately I'm pretty much in the same boat as I was last time I posted. today and really this whole last week has been pretty rough for me on account of starting a new job. it's only part time, but for some reason I get so anxious my chest hurts and I find it hard to sleep or eat even when I'm off the clock. once I'm AT work, it's fine, more or less- I just get in my own head and can't handle it.

  
I've (sort of) been diagnosed with ""mild"" OCD, ""mild"" ADHD and ""mild"" autism from a psychiatrist I saw a few times. it wasn't super helpful because he didn't explain what that means for me, what signs got him to those conclusions or anything else- just said ""you should probably focus on dealing with your anxiety first- I'll refer you to a therapist"" and then never contacted me again.

  
currently I'm in a bit of a spiral thinking about how I'm in the exact same place I was 5 years ago. back then, I told myself if I was still the same heavy, unattractive, masculine loser as I was then, I'd call it quits. well, I'm there and plus a year in a little over a month. I haven't been able to learn any of the skills I wanted to learn, I haven't achieved anything I wanted to achieve, I (somehow) have even FEWER friends, my mental issues have gotten so bad that I can't even enjoy video games anymore and it takes me forever to even read a document because I'm so scared I'll miss something. my mind is broken and I'm stuck in a body that I hate looking at in the mirror.

  
though the part that guts me the most is the fact I feel like I've DONE everything you're ""supposed"" to do when you're feeling like this. I've been through dozens of therapists and doctors, done my best to be honest, yadda yadda. all they say is the same junk- try going on a walk, try eating healthier, try fixing your sleep schedule. I'm not so vain that I don't think that sort of thing wouldn't help, but it always feels like a bit of a hand wave-y answer- like I'm just a normal person who's feeling a bit blue as opposed to someone with a medical condition. they never sound actually empathetic, they never separate the illness from the person at all- never saying it must be hard living like that. and all that just makes me feel like I'm faking it, like I'm just... making it sound worse than it is- that this is just what LIFE is and I'm somehow inept at managing it.

  
I don't remember the last time I was excited or truly hopeful for the future. I was probably 14 or something, it's been over a decade of constant pain and I've tried for so long to fix it, to push through it but my body stays the same and my mind keeps deteriorating.

I have no one.

I'm so tired.

Fuck me I've even looked at coffins.

I just hate this life. No career, no friends, my family tolerates me. Hell my mom has flat out told me she wouldn't be close with me if I wasn't her daughter.

I just wanna go into the woods, so far away where no one can find me. I wanna fucking garden and live quiet. And just be at piece. 

I live on a damn highway, and its loud and exhausting. People always walk on our land so I never get any privacy if I wanna go outside. Not to mention this weather has been hell in the south.

I'm also struggling with my weight. I'm trying so hard to lose weight but food is probably my only form of happiness and it makes me sick.

Every shape in the room is soft around the edges. Lights smear like pastels under water. There’s this glow, like everything’s alive. I can see the sound of music, can taste the colour purple. My hands feel like they’re holding hands with the air. I breathe in, and it hugs me back.

Ecstasy makes me love everyone. Not like “oh you’re cool” love, but pure, like I’ve known you in all my lifetimes kind of love. I want to hold someone’s face in my hands and cry because they’re just so beautiful. My teeth are clenched tight but I don’t care. My heart’s beating like it’s chasing something but I’m sitting still, smiling so hard it hurts. I look at my own reflection and I don’t flinch. That part’s rare.

And then heroin, heroin is the silence after a storm. It’s the softest blanket in the world, inside my bones. It’s the quiet between two heartbeats. Like nothing matters, not even the sadness I thought would kill me. It wraps around the ache like a lullaby. My limbs go warm and heavy like they’re floating just beneath the surface of a lake, and I’m watching the world through the ripples. Everything slows down. My thoughts go dim like a lamp on low battery. I can finally close my eyes and not see everything I’ve ruined.

But the thing is I know it’s fake. I know it’s a trick.

And the worst part? Even while I’m in it, even when the world feels holy and my skin is made of love, I know it won’t last. I know it’s burning me from the inside. I can feel the crash waiting for me in the dark, chewing its nails, counting the seconds.

I tell myself, this is the last time. I mean it when I say it.

But then life gets loud again. The colours drain. I’m left in my room, empty as a torn gift box, aching for something warm to come back. And I know exactly where to find it.

1m8akum,I need to stop drinking,"I want to preface this by saying I don’t drink a crazy amount, but I recently turned 18 so I’m drinking illegally. I’ve recently been going through a few things that have caused me to develop depression, and while my psychiatrist said it’s situational that doesn’t necessarily help me at all. There’s a lot of addiction in my family so I never had any issues saying no to drinking or any sort of drugs, even when hanging out with my friends who were drinking. But one night they offered me a few shots, and I typically would’ve said no, but they asked me a few days after my mom went to jail and I just did it. I was thinking that my life couldn’t get any worse. I didn’t drink very much at all, I didn’t even get tipsy, but life just seemed a little better, a little less intense. I couldn’t stop thinking about how much fun I had, so when they asked me if I wanted to drink after finals I obviously said yes. I drank a little more this time, so I obviously had a little more fun. My coworker invited me to a party on the 4th of July, I drank then too. But these were all few and far between, but I asked my coworker to buy me alcohol this past weekend, and I have drank every night since then. Monday I just drank in my room, but I blacked out and was just stupid. I did the same thing Tuesday and Wednesday. But it just feels better than being sad and empty all the time. I know I kind of just rambled but I just needed to get it out, and I can’t really tell any of my family obviously so I’m saying it here. If you want to respond that’s great, I appreciate it, but if not that’s okay too because I’m just looking for a place to vent.

1m8aeyr,Been looking forward to today for almost a year...,"From the age of nine, my daughter has been going with me to age appropriate concerts.  She is now 20, and the list of shows that we have attended is so special to me.  Most of them are concerts that are artists that she loved enough to share with me, so when they toured near us, I would get tickets.  For one, we drove 5 hours to a small venue just to watch them perform.   

There is a specific band that she absolutely LOVES, and we went when they came around a few years ago.  It was an amazing show, and even though it poured rain, we loved every minute of it.   Today, the band is back touring in our area, and I decided to spend quite a bit of money to get VIP tickets to the show.  Early entry, PIT right up by the stage in this giant venue.  This was to be the endgame culmination of all the shows leading up to today.  She leaves back to college in a month, and this was the epic crescendo to close that chapter.  The timing, the cost, all of it.

At the end of last week, I came down with a sickness that is not allowing me to go.  I have severe nerve pain, and I cannot handle bright lights or loud sound at all.   I told her that I was not able to go, and she could ask one of her friends to go with her instead.   She was able to get one of her best friends to go with her, but I am so heartbroken right now.   I wanted this to be our memory, and instead, I have to miss it completely.    I know she will have an amazing night with her friend, and I am happy for this, but it hurts so badly that all my plans, all my preparation, and all my anticipation just dissolved in the past seven days.

I am so distraught and I have no one to share this with at all.   I will not ruin her night with my sadness, and to be honest there is no one else out there who could ever understand why this is so important to me.  

Some days, the dark thoughts come back quicker and stronger than you can ever imagine out of nowhere.

1m8ad16,I dunno what to do!!!,"I'm finishing highschool soon, and everyone my age is either planning to go to uni or get a job. Meanwhile I have no clue what to do with my life. I have no desire to pursue a career, no ideals at all. Most students also have a full-time job, which blows my mind. I don't consider myself capable of doing neither of those. I'd either kill myself after graduating or become a housewife if I'm lucky.

I don't think everything will get better. I've been unhappy almost my entire life, and I just suck overall. I don't want this to continue anymore, I'd rather die than know that I'd have to work 8+ hours a day in the end, and for what? Just to survive?? I wish people understood this: some of us are just too weak and not good at anything. I CAN'T think of anything good because of my flaws. 

I have no hobbies at all, I have NOTHING to look forward to. If I dream of something, I know I'll never be able to achieve it. I acknowledge it. And then it just vanishes. 

How do I make my family understand? That I'd rather die instead of carrying on? 

I'm trying to accept this miserable life I have. And that, maybe, I'll have everything I've wished in a parallel reality.

1m896zl,Parents won’t let me take medication,"Was prescribed 50mg of sertraline each night (although sometimes I take an extra one, I know I shouldn’t but I just like to). I don’t feel any negative effects from it, unless I pause and then pick it up again, but overall, no negative effects. And I find that it keeps me calm, less s//icidal, less prone to mood swings and outbursts, just generally a more pleasant person. 

Yet the other day my dad told me not to take it anymore. When I asked why, he insisted that I should be solving my problems in a “natural” way and that if I were to suddenly stop taking it, my brain would not be able to produce its own chemicals properly anymore, so I should stop while it’s early (i’ve only been taking it for about two months). 
I feel so enraged. They’ve caused so many problems for me, I used to try to face them head-on but it didn’t work, anytime I objected, negotiated, begged or pleaded they would always dangle the same thing over my head “oh perhaps you’re right but at the end of the day, you can’t do anything about it because you have no money lolol.” 
Exactly, I have no money, no power, to change anything around me and when I think about it it makes me start to go a little insane. 

All i can do is control my own feelings, by taking this medication. It’s better than doing drugs, isn’t it? And now, they want to take away the little control I have left over my own mind. And for what? I have no negative effects from it. To me, it all just screams a big power trip on their part. They think that in any circumstance, if you force someone to face it head on, eventually it will work. But I’m not a child anymore. That’s not how it works. It’s driving me insane.

1m88sc5,Depressed and stupid,"I've been depressed my entire life, since young childhood. I presume it's genetic since everyone in my family is mentally fucked. 

There have been so many interested that I've had that I couldn't pursue since I just physically couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. So I basically have zero talents/hobbies and I'm academically behind in subjects you just skim past (math)

I've been trying really hard to actually do stuff and I suck at everything. I'm learning math, putting in an hour a day and I still can't do anything beyond basic algebra.

That's just one example, I've put at least 20 hours into 3 different hobbies in the past 2 months (each not total), and I'm beyond bad at all of them without any improvement, to the point where when I did ask for help I was asked if I was trolling because of how improbable it seemed to still be so bad after putting in the work. I also am not expecting to be a pro at any of the things I tried, just to simply see progress but I haven't been.

This has really exacerbated my depression, since I feel like I used it as an ""excuse"" a lot of the time, telling myself I really was capable and if I could just apply myself I could do the things I want to but, it's not true.

Our relationship is loving and healthy. I regularly tell him how much I love him and how much he means to me. I have told him he can talk to me, I have told him I am here for him. When he talks, I listen, and it does seem to help in the moment. Unfortunately, most of the time I think he worries that it is his own burden to bear, so will hold it in a lot or just downplay/minimise it (“eh, I’ll work it out” “I’ll get through it” etc). He also has night terrors that trigger anxiety attacks and make him spiral in otherwise “good” patches. 

Recently, he mentioned quite casually that his therapist had done multiple welfare checks on him to make sure he was still alive. I am very concerned about his nonchalance. 

I remember what it was like. When I decided I wanted to end things, it was so easy to just tell people I was doing fine, they just accepted it. And then I just went and made an attempt. If I hadn’t had a wavering moment partway through and called lifeline, I could have just done it and no one would have been there to stop me. So the dismissiveness is really worrying me. 

So, apart from being supportive, being there, checking in and listening, what can I do? The only person who could pull me out of my suicidal ideation was me, so I am at a loss.

I know that he’s taking advantage of me, manipulating me and breaking me down until I’m nothing, so I can be the person he wants me to be. He lured me in, made me feel safe and understood. But now, every time I open my mouth he puts me down. My words are useless, and I have come to realize that the only right thing I can do is to either tell him exactly what he wants to hear, or just shut up. He makes me hate myself. He makes me feel unlovable and like a burden. I can’t do anything right. One second I’m not enough, and the next I’m too much.  

I don’t have any other friends irl. He is the only one I hang out with. If I leave him I will become completely isolated. I can’t meet people.

1m8apgu,Depressed friend not responding to texts,"I have no personal experience with depression, so please excuse any stupid questions.

A friend of mine is going through depression. Usually, there are times when she doesn’t reply to my texts for 2–3 days. I know that people with depression can have a hard time with texting, so I never called her out on it. She once even told me that she appreciates my patience and sees me as someone she can rely on, so I definitely don’t want to risk putting her under any pressure that might change that.

The current situation is that she hasn’t replied for a week, which is by far the longest ever. I’m still messaging her every day (sometimes just sending a stupid meme or something), just so that she knows that I haven't given up on her.

Am I doing the right thing by continuing to message her like that? Or could it be that each new message feels like pressure for her to respond?

I also thought of calling her on the phone, but somehow I feel that it would be even worse, right?

Also, is it possible that she just consciously wants to be left alone for a while?

I had twins with a girl I was dating for about 10 months, it was her first pregnancy and we lost one of my sons too a premature birth. My other son barely survived, I thank god everyday he let him stay with me. But that’s all I have, being with my gf, I wasn’t even sure if she actually liked/loved me. It sounds crazy but when you’re depressed, you rush into a relationship you don’t know if you really want. With me getting her pregnant it just feels like I trapped her. That wasn’t my intention and she tells me she loves me but…idk. One day she was being a little too open and told me about a time she was at a party and let two guys fuck her. Even though I act as if it doesn’t bother me anymore, I still think about it everyday. Not just the fact that she’s easy and disgusting, but the fact she told someone she “loves”. 
Not too mention my health is dropping by the day, I used to be a varsity wrestler and now I smoke and work everyday. I can’t ever stop working because providing for a family by yourself for a young guy is damn near impossible but I make it work. I don’t have any dental insurance while my teeth are in pain because my mother let me drink soda since a toddler. Speaking of, me and my mother don’t speak, the day my son passed away, my mother told me “just because your son died doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay rent”. I was hello 18 at the time paying her rent to stay in a room at her house. That was over three years ago, and I haven’t spoke to her since. I have no career, it’s impossible to find a decent paying job where I live, my car insurance quotes are like $300 a month just because I’m young male.

1m894al,New to this feeling,"My wife and I recently sold our first home (2.6% rate, 2020 build) and bought across town an older home (1979) a little bigger and with a pool. I saw the open house one day after scrolling Redfin and decided to check it out. I liked it a lot. I came back with my wife, she also liked it a lot. We have 2 children: 3 and 5. 

My wife was okay with moving or staying but we both really enjoyed the house and were getting a little tired of some annoyances at our current. I reached out to a realtor to see about purchasing and everything went very very quickly. 

I am single income household and around 175k gross, maybe 120k net after 401k, insurance, etc. I figured we’re already paying 1850/ month another 1200 won’t break us for a nicer house. New mortgage is $3100.

But now I worry about increased property taxes, inflation in general, how can I help my kids with college now? Will I be able to retire at 60 still? Why would I risk it at a time like this?!? wtf was I thinking?

I have cried every day after moving in. Wtf was I thinking? I’m paying almost double the payment….for THIS?!? I know we overpaid. I miss our old house. Our kids miss it. I feel like such a failure and disappointment. I’ve never felt this way before and am having a VERY hard time. I’ve lost 10 pounds in the past 2 weeks, don’t enjoy anything, sleeping 6-7 hours per night and feel worried literally every moment of the day.

I should’ve done things different. I could’ve done different. I cannot deal with the fact I can’t change it. We were SO happy at the other house and I miss how everything was so much. I miss how I was. I miss how I was with our family. It’s all hitting me so hard and I don’t know what to do.

I have appointments with therapists lined up but just cannot help but feel such overwhelming guilt and anger at myself for screwing up our amazing financial situation without having too much nicer of a house. I cannot stand this feeling and have thought terrible things that I can’t help. 

Selling the house would just reduce our equity even more into a new home and I’m sure it would be almost impossible to sell within such a short period of purchase. So many issues have popped up since we moved in. Our old house would’ve saved money, happiness, time, I just want to go back and prevent this from ever happening.

1m88piw,Does it actually improve?,"Background (sorry in advance if this rambles): I'm not really sure how this goes, so please bear with me as this is more a request for support and constructive input. 

I (M59) have been clinically depressed since I was 13, and medicated since around age 29. And it's gone off and on between **SSRIs** and **SNRIs** and the like (Zoloft, Serzone, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Escitalopram) with varying degrees of success. That's to say, not really. In my 20's, I tried Zoloft and all it would do is give me a false smile even at the worst possible times (if someone told me a close relative was in hospital or had passed, the smile wouldn't go away, so it *felt* artificial.

The past 18 months have been a kil...can't say that, let's say they've been exceptionally dark. I've been out of work, the job market in my field has been dreadful and prospects are slow or non-existent despite having decades of experience in my profession and not being concerned about the level of any future role. I'm taking AI courses to stay sharp so my brain doesn't turn into tapioca. I just want to feel useful and productive and that's been difficult. Spent last year hoping to sell our home which went poorly, looking to possibly try again this year and have dived into the renovations that I can do (physical limitation of orthostatic hypotension, so changing positions, lifting, bending, all make me super woozy). The spouse (F65) has been super supportive but I can't help but to feel rather useless, and sometimes she'll vary from explosive if I don't do something small to exceptionally understanding on what I can do/have done. She tells me to not worry about working as she has it handled well and we can afford to live on 1 income, but I still feel a lack of self-worth that I'm not doing more. 

Plus I've had a tendency in life to well up/tear up, and that's only gotten worse. I have a clinician who monitors medications and switched me off **Escitalopram** to **Paxil** (kept **Wellbutrin** in place at 300mg) about 8-9 months ago, I don't know that it's working, and plus with the health-plan structure, there's not much talking with him and I'm not sure if there is any benefit on talk therapy (last therapist left the practice about 5 sessions in and finding anyone else available was like hitting a brick wall). **So I'm open to input on whether that has helped anyone and how.** 

I suppose what I'm asking is support, advice, help, feedback and input in terms of what I'm doing. To summarize, my psychiatrist sees me virtually every 6 months for med checks only. No therapist for talk therapy (open to changing that if others think it helps) and otherwise given the things I cannot change (job market, etc.). Job situation will *hopefully* change in time, but then I don't see people running to hire someone who's around 10 years from retirement (happy to do consulting, which I've done the last several years).

1m85aqo,I feel empty,"I am 22 years old and have been struggling with mental health issues and addiction for a large part of my life. I often romanticise killing myself and have attempted suicide a few times in the past but nothing too serious, I always seemed too afraid of the consequences (my parents seeing me in that state). I have nothing to look forward to in my life, I’m not missed by anyone, I’m not thought of often, and am easily replaced. I seem to add little to no value in the life of people around me.

A couple of months back I realised how empty my life was and decided I’ll take my life the first month of next year if I can’t seem to turn it around. That is the month my best friend passed away and it seems fitting to me. It is July and right now I feel like I can’t do much to make my life better.

My friends are not happy for me; they haven’t been outright about it, but I can feel their gazes piercing through me, shredding my self-esteem to smithereens. They’re upset that I’ve moved on and opened a relationship too quickly post-breakup/active divorce. All I’m told is that they don’t know who I am, or that the choices I’m making are leading me down a dark path. I’ve already wasted 10 years of my life with an abusive ex, lost countless friends because of that ex, and felt immense guilt for allowing someone I thought was a friend to SA* another friend. I lost my job due to severe depression from the tail end of that trauma and lost my ex because I was no longer a cash mule for them to leech off of. Despite all of it, I’m not even given a “wow, you’re doing it.” I’m happy you got out of that awful apartment. I’m happy you’re sexually liberating yourself. I’m happy you feel comfortable and have autonomy over yourself again… Nope, just guilt and shame. I genuinely have no one. My family lives so far away, and I don’t have the financial means to visit them whenever, especially during a new hire probation period. Now, I self-sabotaged the only relationship I have with someone out of shame. I’ve been called a fake, a flake, a slut, and it just keeps rolling in.

1m7woj1,Why am I so untalented,"No matter how much I try at anything I can never be as good as anyone else whos been doing it the same amount of time, or less, and its starting to make me sick. I feel like everytime I start to get remotely good at something I just hit a roadblock, even putting in 10x the effort of those around me i end up doing it 10x worse than them. I'm an adult, specifically a uni student, and this has been happening my entire life. im not good at fucking anything.

i just barely got by in school, but not without struggling with EVERY single topic, math, science, english, athletics... Im bad at all of them no matter how many hours I pour into studying and trying my hardest (I still end up in the average classes). 

It doesnt just apply to academics, its also every hobby ive ever had. Ive been drawing my entire life and my brother, whos only a year older is YARDS better than I am even though I draw way more. Not an exaggeration by the way he makes big painting masterpieces and has a nice social media following, while I'm just here struggling on the same shit I was 3 years ago.

No matter what I do my best is everyone elses minimum. Art, academics, video games, my instrument, I suck at it all. I just can't keep up with everyone elses gradual improvements with age or in general cause I have the skills of a 10 year old in everything. Damn, even socially im inept. Can't even interact with people on the same degree as everyone else, without panicking or embarrassing myself.

I just wish I could be good at something for the first time in my life without coming dead last or falling flat completely.

1m84mgc,How do i know I'm depressed?,"For as long as I can remember this has been a question on my mind. My biggest fear is that all of this awful feelings are just regular sadness. 

whenever something bad happens I shut down. I stay in bed and i don't eat because my food intake is all i can control. I cry and I dwell. But its never long enough that i start ignoring my responsibilities in life.
I have been struggling with self-harm for a few years, I know it is bad but I let the day to day bad things in my life pile up until I cant bare it anymore and i do the thing and it is like all my problems go away. Go away until i feel them pile up and punch me again that is.
I feel like I just have this ball of darkness and anxiety in me, Sometimes I temporarily forget it is there but then it always comes back. and then there are days when its quiet and days that are very loud.

But even with all that I can manage to do what is needed of me so i am really confused. A part of me wants to be just regular sad but that scares me because it means all of the pain and sadness i feel is what everyone feels and that just means I am weak. A part of me wants it to be something more because that means there are ways to have it gone for good. But for that to happen too I have to speak up and ask help from my parents.

1m84ay9,Feel like things are slipping away…,"Hi all, not really sure why I’m posting - maybe to vent more than anything - but I’ve woken up the past few days feeling awful.   I was severely depressed 6 years ago, to the point of considering suicide, and I feel like some of my currently feelings are resembling where I was at the beginning then.

I have 3 amazing kids that I have 50% of the time and an incredible job that pays extremely well and keeps me engaged - but I feel like that’s about it.  I’ve been dating my GF for 2.5 years and she’s amazing but she has 2 kids who are a challenge (tolerable) and an ex husband/coparent who has continued to cause problem after problem.  

We were starting to look at houses together and I was planning on proposing this fall.  Her kids mentioned to their dad that we were thinking about moving in together and he lost it - started harassing both of us, started telling the kids bad things about us, got a lawyer to try getting more custody, etc.  I put a pause on moving in together and getting engaged until after I see how this plays out.  And the more I think about it the more I’m coming to the conclusion he’ll always cause problems in our life and it’s made me feel like my life has stalled…

I feel like I’m not working “toward” anything now (before it was a house with her), I feel like my life is mundane, IDK.

Ever since I was a kid I was always told I was pessimistic, I always thought the worst of everyone and everything. I remember how I would think about my family dying and I would just cry. I always knew I was off especially when I got into high school which was when Covid started so my freshman year was online, during this time I did not  do my school work cause I was home all day and I didn’t care I ended up just playing video games  and masturbating an abnormal amount. This is also the time when my mom found out that I was cutting my self on my shoulder, obviously she ended up crying cause I’m the last person she would of thought that would be doing this, weirdly my sister didn’t really seem to care in fact she used it against me in an argument in front of other people her exact words were “that’s why you cut ur self” or something along those lines. The main reason I’m here is why am I like this my childhood was pretty good I’ve been through nothing super traumatic Pretty normal overall but for some reason I have no drive I literally don’t wanna do anything, I don’t wanna talk to people I don’t want to work but I know I have to but I just don’t care to but I know I should. I have no ambition even if I did I have no sense of accomplishment everything I do end up working for and finishing I get no sense of happiness or accomplishment I feel nothing which is probably why I don’t wanna do anything, why do something if I’m gunna feel nothing, when I graduated I didn’t feel happy I just felt relived, “now I don’t have to worry about my mom worrying ima fail” was my first thought, I’m just a sack of flesh walking amongst people I truly feel like a robot plz help me",7,0,1753324050.0,depression,Longjumping_Bar_6124,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m7sisq/i_dont_know_whats_wrong_with_me/,2025-07-25T09:58:04.989705

1m7s46e,An empty shell,"I am the shell of someone who once lived here. Whoever she was, whatever it was who once resided has left. That inner glow, that warmth has been replaced with bitterness, darkness and emptiness. I try to move through the motions of the day, but most of the time I stay in bed. The only place that feels safe to me. No one to infect with my darkness. Nobody to see it. 

I’m in love with a man I’ve never met and could never be with. How pathetic. But I am. I’m also in love with a man who I left, for no logical reason, for no good cause, simply because I was, and still am, delusional. I don’t live in this reality. I may as well be living on a different planet. 

I go to bed unhappy, I wake up unhappy. I stare at the walls of the bedroom. I stare into space; numbed by the medication I take. Sometimes I wish I could cry, at least then I would feel something. At least I would have an emotion.

I want to connect with people. I want to feel a part of something. But I can’t. The anxiety and the fear of judgement gets in the way. I say nothing most of the time, and I just ask about them. I have nothing to add to conversations. Nothing. My sense of humour has turned dark, attempting to make light of the things I feel and think. I don’t find joy in anything. Imagine that for a second, please? Not in a person, not in a friend, not in a hobby, not in the past nor the prospect of the future. 

The future looks just as bleak as the past. I would love the thought of a bright future, but there’s no fire starter left inside. Nothing to start the engine, if you will. Life without the man I chose to leave has been nothing short of awful. I miss him every fucking day. 

Anyway, while all of this exists in my reality, I have to sit by and watch, like a sick and twisted film of torture, everyone else live. I can’t watch the film anymore. It’s like dangling some sweets in front of a child, taunting them, but never giving it to them.

I’m functioning and I have a job, I pay my bills, I can smile if I have to. But I feel so disconnected from life that it’s hard to call what I’m doing “living.”

I spend most of my time alone. Not because I have no one. I have friends, technically. Family, too. But even when I’m around them, it doesn’t feel like connection. It just feels like I’m borrowing someone else’s life for a while. 

And the retreat isn’t even miserable that’s the weird part. I don’t cry I don’t rage I just kind of exist. I play games. Watch YouTube. Order food. Repeat. I don’t hate it. But I don’t love it either. It’s like being stuck in emotional grayscale.

The thought of trying to change feels exhausting. I don’t want therapy. I don’t want advice. I don’t want to be told to go for a walk, journal, or “just put myself out there.” I’ve heard all of it. I’ve tried some of it. And the truth is, the idea of effort feels heavier than the numbness I’m living with.

It’s not even sadness, really. It’s just that nothing feels real or meaningful. I see people chasing goals, building families, grinding for promotions, seeking connection and I can’t relate. I don’t think I want any of it. But I also can’t shake the feeling that I’m missing something. That I’m meant to feel more than this.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m just built differently like I was never wired for ambition, or deep relationships, or whatever it is that keeps people going. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe I’m just a quiet person living a quiet life. But there’s this dull ache, this vague sense that I’m disappearing from my own story, one passive day at a time.

So basically ive been a metal head since we met always liking system of a down, slipknot, korn, etc. But over the past 6 months ive lost interest in all of it and now i only like soad but only a few songs… so i decided i wanted to start listening to a new type of music and my girlfriend is emo so i told her i wanted to be emo so we could be emo together and i could have a new music type to listen to and she got mad telling me that my brother is already emo and she doesnt want me to be emo cause its just “not like me” and her and my brother were like “your not emo i never pictured you as emo” and stuff like that and i was just like “but im tired of metal i want to try something new and i wanna do emo so i can fit in” and my girlfriend basically was like “whatever do what you want idc” and stormed away.. my brothers already emo and they spend so much time together and i feel like theyre gonna get back together because they used to date but my brother thought she wasnt playful but then when i started dating her she WAS playful so i think he wants her back and theyre bonding and spending sm time together and leaving me left out and my gf seems to always be mad at me and ive been getting depressed and i think i may have developed bpd.. my possible bpd has been harming our relationship more because im extremely obsessive and need her 24/7 but when shes always mad at me and is playing with my brother, i get incredibly jealous it hurts really bad. ive talked to her about it many times and she told me i need to fake happiness cause im ruining our relationship and ruining her and my brothers days.. so now i cant vent anymore to her and im kind of scared of her just a little bit but im obsessive so im still too much in love to leave her. what do i do? please leave ANY comment or thoughts below!

A female from my past messaged me and we talked as friends with no intimacy involved.

1m81zde,I can’t take my mom’s moods anymore,"

I can’t take it anymore. I haven’t been able to take it for a while but I love her and always keep letting myself be sucked into her bs. 

She has the worst mix of depression and narcissistic personality traits. 

She grew up spoiled af, gave it all up for my dad who had nothing, emigrated from her home country. She saved his life (before they got together, he was about to unalive himself), gave him purpose. Happily ever after.. ish. 

They were kicked out by my dad’s bs family clan that were controlling, racist, and straight down evil. They were amazing parents to both my brother and me. Loving, absolutely self sacrificing (which grew to be regretted - yay), my mom was an incredible SAHM while my dad worked himself up the career ladder. 

Problem is: they, especially my mom, had that obsession of being the best parents ever and she had one single goal in life: a happy family. Well, my brother grew up (actually has been all his life) a sadistic, manipulative, abusive POS. Meaning, my mom’s one and only goal in life was never fulfilled. Her loving and understanding and caring mask(?) that she had for 20 years fell and it was all about herself and her pain and her mistakes (that she didn’t make). She is full of insecurities and vanity and I was left to care for her mental health together with my dad but I can’t take it anymore. She is a control freak on matters she has no control over and doesn’t respect therapy but is absolutely delusional about being strong. Every few weeks or months of being better, she spirals again, threatening with ending the pain which manipulates us of course. I am sure that if she ends it, my dad will follow and that breaks my heart in a million pieces. They are trauma bonded and codependent to a fault. 

This is not about ending it, I hope the post will not be deleted for it. I am just so done with her self pity and self centered mood swings. 

Today’s my dad’s birthday. I call him on facetime, he doesn’t pick up. I call her, and already roll my eyes internally bc she has a pissed expression. I ask her how she is. “Thanks, I’m doing shit.” No explanation. Can’t she get a grip ONCE?? Every fucking anniversary or holiday in my life has been fu ked. Either my brother threw tantrums and hissyfits, or since we are all no contact with him, she has her breakdowns. She has a shit son that she scarificed a lot for, yes. But I was the one being abused in EVERY way, yet “I will never understand her pain bc I am not a mom nor will I ever be” (bc I don’t want kids). I could get over it but she refuses to. I am so DONE. And I was planning on having dinner with them later. Yay me. 

What should I do? How should I proceed in order to keep/get my peace? I love my parents but every time I draw any kinda boundary, my mom respects it for a minute, then breaks it bc “she is my mom, she has the right”. Yeah, no. And if I don’t agree “I am just as bad as my brother, this whole life is bs and she should end it”.",1,0,1753356918.0,depression,TwoSorry511,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m81zde/i_cant_take_my_moms_moods_anymore/,2025-07-25T09:58:04.989705
1m81q68,Sad and depressed,"Hi,I am a 19 year old student in Singapore that is just depressed a lot. 
I just have way too many issues in my life at once. First and foremost, I have a gambling addiction since I was 16 and have just kept relapsing again and again. This took a lot of my mental health and everytime I think about the amount of money I lost,I just want to kill myself and end it to be honest. 
My health is also shit as my BMI is borderline 40 which caused me to have the lowest self esteem ever. I feel like everyone just judge me and treat me like I am non-existence because of how fat I am. I am only 160cm...
However,even if I want to end it,I cant as I still have to take care of my family. My parents are already almost 70 and 60 respectively and I have an older sister who have down syndrome and basically need 24/7 supervision cos her mental age is probably like a 5-6 years old.
We are also hella poor and like many stuffs that I want come from my own part-time job money.
All this basically means that in the future,I am the only breadwinner in this family but how am I supposed to provide when my life is already in shambles with the gambing and obesity issue.
All these are taking a toll on me and these days,I have 0 energy doing anything. I see everyone my age going out with friends and having fun but when it comes to me. I am basically alone because everyone thinks I am awkward and rather avoid me.

1m81428,"Aimless, empty and hurt.","I'm losing myself and my will to go on.

For the past few months I've hit rock bottom, even if I thought I did so several times in the past, this feels different. I feel I'm completely lost and lack any sense of direction and self worth, and I've fallen into addiction (sex with escorts and compulsive masturbation) because of not being able to handle present life and my past, specifically one very traumatizing childhood. Sometimes my anxiety and PTSD hurts so profusely, my soul starts hurting, like actual physical pain. 

I'm an artist, and illustrator and writer, and it has always given me a sense of purpose and catharsis to be able to channel that pain into something creative, but for the first time I feel I'm distancing myself away from that and falling into a very self destructive behaviour in order to cope with life, to cope with myself, instead of keeping my mind busy with the only thing it truly makes me happy. I have no family, I haven't seen my brother in years, my father is dead and my mother and I aren't on good terms since she is a chronic alcoholic and is mentally ill. Only my senile grandmother is what's left and what could she possibly do considering how much she has left. I have a deep sense of shame and deep down I believe I don't deserve good, even if it's artistic skill and prowess, which has always been a part of me and has always been a shining light amongst a sea of unfortune and pain.

I'm scared because I can't create, and for anybody who's creative, that means something very serious is going on, which could perfectly push somebody to ""off""  themselves, because not doing so makes me even more depressed than how I already am at baseline level, which in the past I countered it with art, now it's shallow pleasure in order to temporarily escape my agony, and the further I go down that rabbit hole, the more distanced I feel from myself, from who I always was. I lost my spark.

1m7xgzs,Feeling Lost,"I am unsure of if this is depression or not, but I'll do my best to explain. I went the past 6 years on an emotional roller coaster, good and bad happening, some things amazing some things pushing me to the brink. Finally after getting my life in order, I thought things would get better overall. I landed a job, my personal affairs are sorted, at this moment in time I get two days a week to spend doing what I thought I wanted which I figure is pretty good. Yet somehow everything feels empty. I don't get joy from games, or going outside, or buying stuff, or even just listening to music while laying down anymore. It feels like I exist simply for the sake of existing without joy or pleasure. I honestly can't even say that I'm sad or feel like doing anything drastic, more like the ability to feel joy has just slipped away. I genuinely had the idea in my head that getting a job and having everything handled with disposable income would be what gets me out of this feeling. I'm sure some group of people here have felt the same, no? How do you get past it? How did you find things enjoyable again? Is it just a waiting game or is there something that I'm just not understanding that's right in front of me?

1m8116j,I fed up and ashamed,"I just got a call from someone wanting to talk about something ,  after the call was done I could literally fell my heart beats , my head hurt  and my hands were shaking , and even after almost an hour I'm having trouble functioning and have to sometimes take a breath manually.

And I'm sitting here thinking , when did become someone so scared of a conversation or better yet a phone call , when did I become someone who needs medication to just function properly ( not prescribed medicine but the one's you can buy without needing one , and no I'm not talking about weed or any other plant from the devil's garden )
, when did I become someone who shuts down and goes on auto pilot the moment things become a little bit inconvenient .

I'm tired because I am in point in my life where I should be out in the world enjoying life as a young man ( I'm 24 for context ) but due to decision I made as a kid and being just a lazy piece of crap as a teenager ( I didn't even finish or attend high school , I dropped out of school in maybe 6th or 7th grade due bullying and being the oddball in almost every scenario and used my mother's bad mental health as excuse/tool to get out and to this day only a handful of people know I was being bullied/had abusive school friends ) and refusing to make any efforts towards anything , I feel hopeless and stuck in life .

I tried making an effort when it comes to education but no matter how hard I try , I just can't make anything stick no matter how hard I try .

And before you say anything about family , long story short , I might as well not have one , my dad who was an abusive drunk husband died when I was six , my mother's mental health started deteriorating not long after and as a result picked a fight ( verbally) with my friends and their parents and my relatives ( still does sometimes) and as a result I had to face the backlash for no reason ( none of them actually said anything to me , they just stopped interacting with me and ignoring me altogether ) , over the years we did become ""friends"" again as young adults , but I don't have anyone I can talk to about any of this because later on I will cuss myself out for saying anything and everything that I said or didn't say.


I do have a job , it pays good enough and I hate it but I'm well aware everywhere will be just as hectic if not worse ( food industry ) .


I know I'm painting myself as a victim but I'm painfully aware of how I'm responsible for everything that's happening in my life. I mean I'm no longer a kid or a teen , I'm a working adult with mental health issues with childhood trauma who is also lazy and a procrastinater . All I have to do is get off my but and start doing something that will make me feel alive, but HOW? I have tried doing things but it's like all of sudden my feet get heavy and I feel unworthy of breathing the air around me and the next I feel like a victim of life and get busy feeling sorry for myself ( like I am while I write ) .

1m7s7fl,I'm already stressed about school,"I was accepted into my preferred university, but things just haven't gone as I might have hoped. I've lost all drive. I'm not interested in anything. I switched from a waste of time program to computer science, but I'll need to take a couple of math courses in the coming fall semester, and I'm not confident that I'll be able to pass them. 

What if I fail... If I drop out and have to work an ordinary job, I probably will kill myself. 

Why can't I just find something interesting...

At my summer job the boss told me today that a guy tried scaling the cliff by the property and died. How easily people die. Behind every statistic are people who had friends, and hopes...

I'm tired. 

I just want to leave this shitty world. It is seriously a nightmare for me. Maybe it's fine for some, maybe for most, but I feel like a fish out water... or like a person in a vast desert. Baked by a cruel sun and deprived of water.

I feel that fate often... is rather... unkind.

But, whatever I guess for now I just try to keep to studying math on the daily with the hope that by the end of next month I'm not super screwed. 

I actually do like math, it's just that I had a super messed up childhood and school fell into the background as a priority... I really envy kids whose parents actually cared and tried to guide them towards happiness and success. 

I was nothing more than a tool.

...

I was playing a video game a while ago, I started on the hardest difficulty and realized not long after beating the first boss that it wouldn't be fun if I didn't switch to a lower difficulty. I feel like I'm at the same place with life; I started on hellish nightmare mode, and now I don't want to play anymore unless I can switch in down to normal mode. At least in that game I was able to switch it down... I could have beaten it... but I wouldn't have been able to use the characters that I liked... it would have turned into a chore. Life shouldn't be a chore.

I'm worried about the future. It would have been nice if I had been able to just focus on what I was studying previously, but it felt like such a waste of time. 

I can't force myself to do anything that I'm not interested in. It just doesn't work. 

Either I take these math courses, which I like, but might fail, or I take something which I'm not interested in, and fail anyways.

What if I fail? I just don't have an answer for that question. 

What would I do with my life? 

If I can just make it through the next three years of school... at least I won't feel like a failure anymore, and more door will be open to me... If I don't... graduate... I will feel so lost and hopeless. I might just kill myself if it comes to that. I mean, what would the alternative be? I can't even fulfill my obvious destiny of being a sad clown because circuses don't even really exist like that anymore.

1m7yvf3,I was molested by my cousin since i was 8,"It all started when i was around 8yo. Cousin from my dads side was maybe 14/15yo. I stayed with him a lot at that time couse our moms were going out for jogging, walks etc. I was staying always at his place, and everything was normal until I heard a word sex and none of adults wanted to tell me what that is. So I asked daughter of one of my moms friends and she told me, but as a 8 year old girl i did not belived her, so I asked my cousin and that’s how it started.

He sat down and started explaining what that is and he made me really confused. He talked about it for so long and i didn’t understood any of the words he said and as a child I did not cared at all, but after this he was so excited about that I know what sex is and he started from things like making sex poses in clothes to show me how it looks. He told me to do a dog pose so i did, he grabbed my waist and started simulating sex in this position, he also showed me in the same way missionary pose.

The next thing what he was doing back then was searching for adults films with youngest girls he could find or the girls that looked their youngest just to show me that its normal and girls my age do stuff like this. He everytime was talking about being a virgin is something bad and i shouldnt be one.

I asked him one day if it’s okay to do stuff like this with a cousin because i was scared that im doing some kind of sin, he told me that if i was his sister i would not be okay, but a lot of cousins are getting married and everything and that is completely okay.

Once he showed me a dildo and asked if i want to try it, and i didn’t wanted and i didn’t tried.

He very often simulated sex with toys.

Then everything was worse and worse, i remember that we were in room that was just for his toys, he told me to lay down, he pulled my pants down, rolled up my shirt and made some comments that im starting to grow boobs and my 🐱 started to grow hair (i was 9-10)(i was this kid that grew up really fast) then he started to lick my 🐱 I pushed his head out from between my legs and told him to stop. There was couple of situations like this. He made a lot of comments about me growing.

Once he asked if i want to make an adults movie and i didn’t wanted, he was asking me non stop and i said that he will show his friends and everything and i don’t want to do that. And we didn’t recorded anything, atleast i don’t know that we recorded something.

Next situation was when we were in the car, my and his mom were in the pizzeria to get us pizza and next to pizzeria was florist and his mom needed to go in there so we were waiting in the car that was parked right in front of pizzeria, he put his penis out and told me to do blow job and lick it, i did not understood what that was so i just licked it and he told me to suck on it and i didn’t wanted to do that, he put his pants on and was like mad at me or something that i didn’t follow his words. When this happened i was around 9 years old.

Next thing and the worst of all was that i was lying on the mattress he pulled up my shirt and pulled down my pants and panties, he also pulled his pants and boxers down and started to rub against each other and then he asked me again if i want to be a virgin, I still didn’t knew what that was and i said that i don’t know and he said something like if i want to be a grown up just like the other girls and i said yes and then he took his penis and put just the head of the penis in me. I didn’t liked it, that was a little painfull. But there was no sex. After he just told me ”now you are not a virgin”.

Everything ended when i was maybe 12, i was at my grandmas house for summer and he also was there  we were on the second floor of the house and he sat down while i was watching a movie and he started to show me adults films, I was irritated and went to the bathroom, i didn’t wanted to go out so i just sat down next to sink and i saw how he is looking at me behind the blured glassed part of door, i screamed at him to get the fuck out from behind that door.

After that we hadn’t meet each other very much because our sides of families started to not like eachother.

The whole childhood i spent at thinking if im virgin or not, if im a sl*t or something. Then i started to sending this memories at the back of my head and i forgot about everything. Right now im almost 17, i have my first real stable relationship and somewhere in june this year i remembered this situations again and told my boyfriend about it, he called my parents and told them everything, when i returned home from boarding school they told me that they know and i was furious but now i know that he was just worried and cared about me. We are still together and thanks to him i will recive help that i need. People know about it right now after all this time, because i never told anyone and i repressed all the memories and succesfully forgot, i know that there is a lot more than i just wrote but i can’t remember more, maybe after some time. I don’t know what to do with everything, i see how my friends react with tears in their eyes and i just can’t show any emotions, i don’t know why, everyone say that it’s because i repressed memories but i don’t know. I just want to find someone who lives with similar situation as mine. I need someone to talk to about it, who lived thru something like this.

1m7nonx,I'm just done with life,"I feel so tired of life, life has just been down hill for the past 6 years. I have been diagnosed with Generalised anxiety disorder and depression and honestly I might be on the spectrum, but I'm not sure. A lot of things have been going on in my life, and I just need pll to talk to.

My family is a dysfunctional mess sometimes. My dad is very stubborn and can be an inconsiderate jerk sometimes. He always puts his opinions first and rarely consider our thoughts on things. He also hates technology alot he can't stand it, or bother to understand it. My mother Is a very good and supportive person.i care about her deeply, but she's always so sad, and never happy. She always works hard for us. She's the glue that keeps us from falling apart. I love her so much but it's painful to never see her happy. Glen there are my younger brothers. One of them, the youngest one gets on my nerves. He is always rude and bratty never caring for how hard my parents work to provide for us. He always believes he's right and he can do no wrong. Then there is my other younger brother who is autistic, but a sweetheart. He loves us all and cares deeply.

I don't want to be ungrateful, I know a lot of ppl are way worse off than me. But I'm just really tired of it. For 7 years my family has been put under more and more debt, and we always live pay check to pay check. I'm grateful for all I have. But sometimes I guess I just feel fed up. I feel tired and like it's kinda unfair. Honestly some If not a big chunk of the debt is my father's fault. He keeps making stupid investments always ignoring mine or my mother's advice.

In school I'm an outcast. No one wants to interact with me. They talk behind my back when they think I'm not paying attention. They think I'm weired for not being obsessed with sports and beauty etc like them. They find it weired that I find science, tech, and fiction cool. Most of the time it's just petty insults, the worse I've gotten is threats and harrasment. I feel so exhausted from tip toeing around them for so long. I feel tired of being the weirdo. I just want to be treated normally without all the ridicule.

Even in my tiny friend circle I'm always the ""backup"" sure we hang-out and we care for each other. But I'm not anyone's favourite or anything. All of them have their own pair or best friend while I'm just like a back up incase no one is available. At least that's what it feels like.
Same can be said about my family, we (mostly) love each other but I'm no one's favourite. And this kinda hurts. Knowing that no one cares about me so deeply.

My GAD and depression has also made my school and day to day life bad. I'm always worried that smt will go wrong. I always feel paranoid and sad like there's nothing good about life and everyone is ouf to get me. I can't even go outside or do anything without feeling anxious. I used to be a straight A student but now my grades are diping hard. Because of my depression I can't study well, and even when I do, I get destracted with what if. And it's really important that I do good these last few years if I want to get into a good uni and it's not like I can afford one without scholarship.


Another thing is how bad the system is here. The rich are literally given access to uni test answers on a silver platter, and there are only a certain amount of seats for foreigners. The school system is very had and inconsistent. At this rate I will never be able to do anything and become homeless or smt!

Also the racism  can be so bad here. A lot of ppl treat you like you are beneath them and like you don't matter. They can threaten you and scam you and get away with it cause they are local or what not! A few days ago a lady threatened to kill me! Which triggered a nervous breakdown form me. 

Idk I'm just so tired of my head messing with me, I'm so tired of being broke, and I'm so tired of the world being against me. I just feel like there's no hope. Ppl tell me things will get better. But when? I've been suffering for 7 years now.

I enjoy watching films and other things but I see no point in them. I mean what’s the point in buying posters or decorations for yourself? There is no point and it’s a waste of money. 

But it makes people happy, it used to make me happy, but now I can’t get over how every single thing in my life has no purpose at all. I’ve stopped working out and eating healthy because I could care less hopefully I’ll die soon anyway. But then again I’m wasting money on teeth health related things which is meant to be a long lasting investment is it not? 

Then I have a job having to deal with people which is not bad but biking home in 100 degree weather for 20+ minutes is starting to make me want to get ran over even more. I wish I was dead, in a coma, or not human at all. Why is life so fucking miserable? Why do we buy things to distract ourselves and keep us happy from how shit the real world is lol.

1m7y6z3,why was I given up by my dad then abused by my step dad? Am I the problem?,"

I’ve always wondered why my father left me. He didn’t even want the chance to know me. He rejected me in front of my own face and said I wasn’t his son. That hurt me a lot and I was just broken, i wasnt ready for that type of feeling at all young age. He wanted nothing to do with me and it was clear, but before that happened my mother had a fiancé and I thought he was my dad. Thats what my mom would tell me at least but he would treat me so different from his kids when people weren’t around. (my mom is there mom) he would always take me to work with him in his 18 wheeler. I loved it and had so much fun on the road with him. Until he changed, they started getting into arguments and he would take his anger out on me. He started beating on me.  instead of telling family or the school i just kept quiet and dealt with it because that was the only “father figure” in my life. All I wanted was a dad. I loved him though even after the stuff he did to me. Things were  different In front of my mom and siblings he was the best person in the world but when it was just me and him it was like he wasn’t him anymore. One time he burned the crap out my foot all because I had an accident on myself. He turned the water up to the highest temperature in the bath. He grabbed my leg and placed it in the buring water and wouldnt let go till I would cry and beg him to stop. The burns were very bad I don’t know to much about how the burn was. Again i. Was only a kid. My older brother came home from school and seen I was crying my but off in the corner and could tell something was up. He asked my step dad what was wrong with me. He said that i pooped my self then he put me in the shower to clean my self. My brother came to me and asked what happened. He seen my foot and how bad it looked he automatically called my mom and everything went from there. I forgiven him. His mother (owned a church btw) bought me some type of Batman toy set ( I still have the picture of it) so I wouldn’t say anything to the school. Which it worked, I loved toys.but the abusing kept going on behind closed doors and wouldnt come to light. Until finally him and my mother got into a big argument and he hit her. Seeing my mom crying on the floor struck a fire in me. I grabbed an extension cord and hit him with it. He punched me and shoved me across the living room where I hit my head on the wall. My mom grabbed me and took me and my brothers to our room. So she could call the cops. He tried taking her phone but we locked the door so he just left. We were staying with his brother. He wanted us out because the cops came to his house. They seen the knot and bruises i had previously. My mom left him for good. everything got covered up by the church his family owned. The church told the cops I would make up lies and hit myself just to get him in trouble. There’s no way a 9 year old could make that big of a knot in his own head. The cops dropped everything. Saying there wasnt evidence that he did it. The only father figure i had would abuse me but then treat me so nicely in front of everyone else. Thats what made me forgive him all those times I hate knowing he got away with it and how his family’s church lied for him. but now he’s trying to take my mom to a custody battle for my brothers. (Hes their biological dad) i told my mom I wanted to go to court with them and tell them what he did to me but I guess you can’t when it’s a whole different case. But anyways that leaves me thinking. Am I just unlovable? did i deserve it? Like i hate thinking about how my dad didn’t want me and how someone who was supposed to play that dad role just betrayed me. Maybe because I wasnt his blood. I came to a realization that I’ll never have my dad in my life. I see my friends with their dads and how their bond is. and I just tear up because why couldn’t I have that? I get so mad with myself because now I’m 16 and I still let that shit get to me. I hope that my dad comes back sooner or later but honestly I doubt it. I have no contact with him. At all.

1m7u7ss,How do people create life goals? Is it bad to feel like I need one to survive?,"I have come a long way with my mental health and personal growth in general. I have felt very proud of myself lately for that. I think what pushed me was having a goal for the future. It has been a year or two since I created it (to move to another country) and I think I've gotten to the point where it doesn't work anymore. 

I have always been bad about thinking/planning my future. I like a lot of things and am good at a lot of things but none seem to be enough to actually commit to. I can't for the life of me pick a career. I haven't been able to do any of my hobbies due to fatigue and motivation issues. 

I feel so passionate about so many things and never know how to do anything with that feeling, which feels heartbreaking. 

My biggest goal I have found is to leave the US. I hate it here. I feel like everything is such a mess and won't be fixed anytime soon. While I'm passionate about politics and the idea of bettering the country I don't think I will ever be able to have that drive to actually do anything to help change it. So the best thing I could think of for myself is to just leave. I would still be able to do just about as much as I am currently. 

I have never even chosen a destination. I just want whatever country I can get into that is any bit better and as fast as possible. That helped but now I'm having doubts. 

I'm not sure what there is to look forward to. I am not capable of working as much as I need to here to survive. That scares me. I truly think I would rather be dead than to stay here and live like this the rest of my life. Maybe it's crazy but I feel I NEED something to look forward to and I'm doubting there ever will be that. 

Maybe I just need to learn to appreciate each day or something but I'm just not sure I'm built for that.",2,0,1753329229.0,depression,Haunting_Face666,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m7u7ss/how_do_people_create_life_goals_is_it_bad_to_feel/,2025-07-25T09:58:04.989705

1m7xken,Ah Marijuana and 🫁 problems.,"As a child (13) living with ADHD and Autism I was always a casted out person in this world, similar to my father. Similar to my father is a common theme applicable to myself as I followed in his footsteps in getting a marijuana addiction, that he provided for. An addiction with vapes and joints (once in a blue moon.) I have asthma. I have asthma. I have asthma. And overtime my asthma got worse. As my lungs deteriorate so does my brain. Let me go back around 4th grade I met someone named Yazmin, and she would stick with me for some time. A beautiful experience living and speaking to her until like 9th grade. Still should not affect me as I am not 18 and it was nearly 4 years ago thst it ended. Let me get back to the point. My lungs worsened because I broke up in a relationship, a relationship that already made me depressed, and now i am abusing Marijuana, a drug that may reduce gray matter in your brain. That is a big problem and makes me feel like shit more than I already always do. I have tried to kill myself but since that one experience of going to the hospital and seeing my family in dreadful situations from that, I lived and felt the urge deplete until I was left in my own thoughts again and again and again for years (a month after this Leo/Yazmin) broke up with me which led to another worse depression. Instead of killing this pathetic being I call myself, I just keep smoking marijuana everytime Im sad. Vyvanse doesn't do shit. Adderall doesn't do shit. I have a racing brain either way.

1m7lzjf,Self hating bi man,"I struggle with hating myself and feeling like a POS. I’ve been a closeted bisexual since high school, but I started questioning my sexuality even before then. About two years ago, I finally had a place of my own where I could explore my sexuality privately. Unfortunately, that also brought repressed trauma to the surface.

When I was younger, a boy I was friends with molested me for almost a year. I don’t know exactly when it stopped, but I remember telling my mom I didn’t want to play his games anymore. and after that, i only remember being upset. After that school year ended, I stopped hanging around him, but I never felt right again.

I tried to understand what had happened, which led me to discover porn and shortly after, gay porn. I felt confused and started questioning both my gender and sexuality. I thought maybe the feelings I had for boys could be explained if I were a girl. But I eventually grew out of that idea.

Now, scared that I might be gay, I hid those feelings by telling myself I couldn’t be, because I still wanted to be with girls. Internalized homophobia tightened around me like a noose, and I felt scared. I had already dealt with bullies picking on me for my glasses and weight I didn’t want to give them another reason to make my life hell. So I did something I’m deeply ashamed of: I started making bigoted remarks. I hoped that by making homophobic jokes and putting down queer people, no one would suspect me of being anything but straight.

The guilt I feel is why I don’t believe I can be a part of the LGBTQ+ community. It doesn’t help that when I tried asking for advice from the queer community about my feelings and shared my trauma, some bad actors steered the conversation toward sexually explicit topics. That only deepened my disconnection and even led to resentment toward parts of the community.

On top of everything, I grew up religious and don’t identify as politically left-leaning, which fills me with even more dread. Because I feel like I have fewer and fewer people I can truly confide in. 
The trauma from what happened to me became clear the first time I had a sexual experience with a man. I couldn’t breathe, my muscles tightened, and I shut my eyes, just waiting for it to be over. I couldn’t stand being touched by men, yet at the same time I was alone with no one else and that’s why I put myself in such an uncomfortable situation. I wasn’t receiving the emotional love I desperately craved, so I settled for physical contact.

I’ve had only a handful of sexual experiences with women, and those were pleasant. I enjoyed myself and felt comfortable being intimate with them. I’ve also had a couple of experiences with trans women, and I felt similarly at ease. But every sexual encounter with men has been a struggle.

I can’t help but feel like I’m allowing myself to be molested all over again because I’m so desperate for any kind of intimacy. The feelings get even more confusing because I’m the one topping. On a few occasions where I tried to bottom, my partners did not respect my boundaries, which only made my trauma feel more real. In those moments, I didn’t feel safe at all. 

I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for by sharing all of this. Maybe just for someone to finally understand. I’m tired of carrying this alone",5,2,1753306517.0,depression,Vast_Award722,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m7lzjf/self_hating_bi_man/,2025-07-25T09:58:04.989705

1m7mimc,I need help to figure out how to escape my current situation <3,"Hey guys(girls),

I was too afraid to ask, but seeing that nothing is happening, I need some help/life advice so I can escape the hole I am rn.

I am 22 years old just finishing my bachelors degree ,  since I graduated school I started working first as a server to make some spare money. I started a year ago in a hedge fund as a trader and I love the job.

Aaaand that's all the ""good"" things around.

4 years ago, I suffered from some problems with my insulin resistance levels and gained 20/25 kilos. I ended a 5-year relationship a year ago and still can't move on. Things at work aint doing great either since you earn a % of what you earn from trading, no fixed salary or smth like that. I have already spent my saved money too. 1 week ago, I had a prom from the UNI, and the photos just came out. To be brutally honest with myself, I just look like a piggy and hate every photo that was taken. I am starting to have problems with my mom since I am not earning money ( my parents are divorced). There are so many bad things happening; it's immense. I always lose motivation to do anything good for myself, studying/training.

So I just came by to ask for some advice on any of my problems, some motivation and so on.  I can give more details if asked, and yeah, I am just tired of life. tbh can't progress in any direction and only suffer bad things

I also voiced my concerns around direction in life and goals in general that I don’t really have any other than survival.

It was really rough until his meds kicked in he was super depressed due to the anxiety. Now shortly after that incident my father actually passed away due to suicide. So we are all well versed with our mental health and do what needs to be done etc. However my husband is a very shut off person and the zoloft I think made that a little worse even, just flattening him.

1m7hrdo,Nothing’s been okay since my dad killed himself in October and I don’t see things getting better.,"My dad died alone in a hotel room with a bottle of tequila and a tub after getting up and walking out of the house during the middle of a work zoom meeting in his office at home.  The last I spoke with him was when we had breakfast that morning mostly in silence since my mom was mad at him for something, then I left for the gym and he was found the next morning.  He never got to see me finish my degree, get my first job, move out and support myself, see my mom recover from her health conditions, nothing just gone.  I feel mad at him for what he did, but yet I think I understand why he did it and more importantly I don’t want to be mad at him.

He and my mom were buried under years of debt still living paycheck to paycheck even when he was making over $100k a year as the sole breadwinner.  The amount of life insurance he left my mom paid all of that and she still has well over $1mil to retire off of since she can’t work due to her conditions.  I should be kinda happy with that silver lining but I’m not.  Before, I was worried they’d end up financially dependent on me while my career isn’t well along yet, now my mom is fully dependent on me to handle most of what dad did, and to comfort her through every breakdown, and to help with this “need to move somewhere else” she’s had for a while.  

I told my degree advisors I was taking a break, put all of the bills they had that I could find into a spreadsheet for her to keep track of, helped her get paperwork for us to move to France (which I’d like to go to too but I worry about supporting my independence there), quit my job (which wasn’t enough to move out on hence why I’m still tied to her), sold my car, sold their cars, packed and organized, emptied 2 storage units in total now, compared pros and cons of different cities in France for her, and when our first run at getting everything lined up in France failed we pivoted to moving across country.  I coordinated movers, flights, parking permits, rental cars, everything while also calling trying to find her new doctors during a move from WA to southeastern MA, then when that apartment turned out to be unsafe and loud we rushed around New England looking for a house since we were then about be kicked out in 3 months, which has now led us to be in a house in a sketchy area of the far western end of MA, and I’m still helping with renovation work, coordinating contractors, getting her doctors, driving her everywhere, on and on and on.  I agreed to help her initially after my dad died because I thought it would maybe be 4 months tops for us to be settled again and because she’s my mom and of course I would, and it’s been over 9 now and her health condition has gotten so bad now without the level of care back west she used to say was bad that she’s genuinely contemplating suicide because she has no friends or family outside of me and I’m trying to leave and start my life.  I want to help her get better but no amount of help seems to shorten the list of shit we/she needs done and by the time we crash at 9 or so for dinner I’m so tired I can barely absorb my studies for my potential future job / degree (which started back up since I took the maximum amount of time I could for break without outright leaving).

Since dad left, everyday that goes by I am reminded of my life slipping away and not making the progress that would fulfill me.  I’ll be 24 in August and I’ll still have not moved out, no started my career, still be broke af, still be the tall skinny fat nerd I was at 15, still have never had an actual relationship, and most of all still hate myself.  I can’t date because my life and all is so unstable I can’t plan out my week let alone a day, not to mention I don’t know if I’ll still be living in this country in a year so why even bother with dating or trying to find a first career job?  Nothing has any point anymore, no substance, no finality, just an endless list of tasks to be done between me and freedom, an endless stream of bs info being absorbed between my moms shit, the house shit, the bs on the news, I just can’t bring myself to care anymore even when I feel I should.  It’s like all my emotions are simulated for the sake of others when all I want to do is either beat someone’s face in or run away and disappear and I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this.  All I want to do is wake up and be someone else, or for my mom to be able to handle all this shit herself or with someone else, to have control over me and my time and I don’t think things will get better.",5,1,1753296818.0,depression,PsychologicalRippady,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m7hrdo/nothings_been_okay_since_my_dad_killed_himself_in/,2025-07-25T09:58:06.129260

Backstory; I have been diagnosed with severe depressive episode a few years ago (brought on by unresolved traumatic events). Got treatment, etc. and things improved greatly. I was doing so well and so happy. 

But this year was insanely stressfull for me. School, running my own business etc. really tested me. Two weeks ago, I went through something minor - that triggered the worst traumatic memories of my life. Ever since that happened, I am in total collapse. Crying all the time, can't get up etc. I have severely bad and obsessive BDD thoughts. I look in the mirror, and what I see is not human. I haven't felt this bad in years.

I am medicated, but can't see my psych for another month. And I need help now. I have no idea what to do. Crying has lessened a bit this past week and I'm starting to eat again so I guess it's getting at least 1% better.

1m7nwkk,No point on anything,"Recently, my girlfriend left me. 
I cannot say i didnt expect It, we have had rough times. Basically stress consumed me: family problems, absolutely 0 success on my studies and a constant feeling of being dragged away from my friends by exams and all that. Sadly, she was the one Who took all that negativity from me, i didnt really tell anyone but her and that finished in the worst of ways.
Now that she has left me I have literally nothing, I have lost my girl ( the hope of each one of my days), we dont live together anynore obviously so I have lost my last home, i feel my friends arent really here and my mom is the only thing i feel i have left.
I dont know if I can take it, for me i was bound to marry her, It was 100% perfect, and yeah, i fucked up but I thought she would give me a last opportunity to make up for everything: never happened, that conversation only made everything worse because i begged her more than I should have so I basically made things more complicated for her.
I have gone to seek help on psycologist and stuff but its useless, i cant really go better if myself doesnt want to stop wanting to be with her ( or at least pretending and convincing myself of so).

1m7np8l,Emotions,"I said last time I was here that I dont have motivation to do anything but exist. The post actually brought on someone who said some stuff to me that could have been very helpful and I wanted to share them here. 
Focus on getting up
Focus on eating
Focus on breathing
Text a friend a joke
Dont worry about the main goal and worry about moving around
All these are great and amazing tips

Im making this post here this time though because I dont know what to do anymore. I keep telling myself im not crazy, that im normal, that im ok, that im fine, I've gotten good at lying too, my own mother and father can't tell anymore that I dont feel good, I've never told my dad about this feeling, I tried telling him one time that I was trying therapy and he interrogated me asking why I thought I needed to go and I just froze. What sucks is both of my younger brothers are in therapy which he fully supports but as soon as I tried to go he basically shut it down. Im glad I feel pain talking about this, I know its weird but pain is the only feeling I have that I can feel in my chest now, I dont even really get angry, I react instinctively to things when I dont actually feel anything, im going off on a tangent. I told my mom and she just used it against me, just like everyone else too, sometimes I notice that my parents love my siblings more and im ok with it. I dont understand why im ok with it though, I dont feel pain towards it, shouldn't I want their love? Shouldn't I want anyone love or want anyone to even want to talk to me? I dont care if people do or dont, I dont even care if people want to hurt me. I turn 21 in 2 weeks, I have a strong will but honestly, Its not gonna last me forever. I feel like im drowning myself by being alive and the longer im alive the more water that empties my lungs. I dont know if that's relatable but I hope it is cause I can't explain it any other way.

So many people starving in Gaza and I’m complaining about my life while i have food and a comfortable bed. I don’t know if u guys can understand that feeling, but I’m trying to explain.

It’s my fault but I can’t seem to accept help, my family want me to do therapy but I can’t stand it, I did it when I was in school and they always had to pin point a reason to why I was sad but half the time i genuinely didn’t know why I just was and they’d always put words in my mouth on how I was feeling. n the whole therapy group thing, I don’t get how sitting and talking about ur problems to everyone else is helpful to me or them or idk everyone’s different.

1m7jvb9,How to deal with the guilt of an attempt?,"I was recently discharged from an involuntary hold after a suicide attempt. I ended up in the ER and was pink slipped. I had started a medication a few weeks prior that gradually made me lose myself. I isolated, became irritable and mean, pushed people away, went through emotional whiplash and put others through it. I woke up one evening after sleeping for 15 hours yet again and felt so tired. Tired of emotional overload and mood swings. Tired of physically aching from the swell of emotions I was feeling constantly. Tired of being drained and tired. Just tired of everything. In an instant I made the choice to overdose. I didn’t even think about it too much. No prior plan. 

I’ve seen the commercials, I read the entire information/warning packet when I get a new prescription. I’ve never felt that way before so I didn’t think I’d experience the “may cause suicidal thoughts and actions” side effect. I’m still working through the way everyone is looking at me now. I have to work through the guilt even though nobody wants me to feel bad. But they all look at me with sad faces and tears in their eyes now. That’s the part that sucks most, I think. I hurt people who love me and I couldn’t stop it happening. Medication isn’t supposed to make things worse but mine did. 

The way they look at me is eating me alive. I have my first psychiatrist appointment next week but I need advice until then. How do I cope with this? What can I do to show them I am recovering well and I am taking my mental health seriously? If I were your daughter, partner, mother, etc… what could I do to reassure you and show you I know I have love and support, and that I have no intention of ever doing something like this again?

I self harm and I have done for almost two years, it’s how I cope with the world around me and the stress my own brain causes me.

1m7mupq,Failing despite trying so hard,"Failed my finals (an oral exam) today. It was the last thing I needed to get my bachelor's degree. I still have one more chance to do the exam, but I'm turning 28 and have been doing my bachelor's for 7 years. After that (if I pass the exam) I'll probably still have to do my master's as it seems like a bachelor in my studies isn't enough to get a job. Everything just feels so bleak.

I feel so disappointed in myself. I studied really hard for the exam and could solve the questions, but when it came to the exam, my mind went totally blank. The professors even tried to help me but I just couldn't do it. I don't know why. 

Since I was a child I had bouts of feeling depressed, but I could somehow manage it. When university first started, things were relatively fine but everything went downhill after the pandemic and I can't seem to climb out of this hole...

I just feel like a big failure. The worst part is that I have people who unconditionally support and love me but yet I feel so sad most of the time and keep failing. I truly try and work hard to feel and get better but it seems to not really work. 

I just can't help but feel like all these resources are wasted on someone useless like me. When I was a child I always envisioned myself to be independent and resourceful, but I just turned out to be an anxeity-ridden adult who can't do anything by themselve....my partner and parents tell me that they are proud of me since they do see me try my best, but I think they are just trying to be nice...I mean how can you be proud if there is nothing to show? 

I'm honestly just so tired, I really don't feel like trying anymore...i often wish to just die but I can't be selfish for the sake of my parents and partner.

1m7lajn,So much of my day wasted,"Today was by my standards a ""good"" day. I spent just under 4 hours learning hobbies that I want to do but, never quiet manage to bring myself too.

It's 5pm, I woke up at 6am. I don't know what I did the other 7 hours of my day. I wish I would've done anything at all but the majority of those 7 hours I'm pretty sure were spent laying down or scrolling youtube trying to find something to distract myself from.. I don't even know what. I just feel such intense apathy that it's physically hard for me to do things even if I want to do them. I was enjoying learning but my brain just feels so ""heavy"" that I felt I needed to not do whatever it was I was doing.

So here I am now, 5pm and I just want to sleep. I can't bring myself to play video games, watch a movie, or do anything. I tried to find something, anything to do but I can't. I'd like to continue working on my hobbies, maybe even finish my summer classes assignments but no, I'm just gonna do nothing.

Going back to those 4 hours, even that's highly unusual for me. Usually it's more like 10-30mins. Sometimes I break an hour but that's very rare. I'm currently a student with no job. I really wonder what my life is going to be like in the future since I physically feel I can't manage even when I have nothing to do, yet the ability to do anything due to a lack of constraints (time, money etc).

I go out of my way to help people and they still put me last. Before you say “Try doing less for people.” I tried both ends. I’ve tried being the asshole as well and nothing works.

1m7l0fr,Help with anxiety due to moving,"Hi there, I am 30M non native speaker, sorry for my English beforehand.

I have moved to another country in Europe due to lack of suitable work in my region (Slovakia). My mother had a surgery, my aunt was tending to her for a few weeks. When I came home for a visit, everything was rather fine, but at the last day of my stay, we had a nasty argument with my aunt. Context - political and job situation and corruption in our region forced me to move countries, and abandon my favorite passtime - gardening. When we were discussing this topic with my aunt, she said something along the lines ""Well, you were not doing much around the house and the garden, it is rather untidy.""  (I prefer ""natural"" gardening - to maximize profit and minimize effort, but no jungle or trash in the garden - is 10 years of tending to garden too little? I have learned everything myself, no father figure, just my wits and passion).

Like, WTF? Who has painted the inner walls after flooding? Who was helping to repair the roof? Who has helped to change the floors and windows? Who planted and grown the trees, that are now bearing lots of fruit? I get it, I am not a all knowing handyman, but i can do atleast some reasonable work.  We´ve had an argument, because somebody dismissed the only thing, that I was proud of. AITA?

I miss my home, I miss my mother, I miss gardening, but due to many reasons I do not want to stay in Slovakia, after many setbacks and frauds from ""my"" countrymen, I can not consider myself to be part of ""that tribe"" no more.

1m7ebp1,Is it weird to offer to pay someone in your building to help take your trash to the chute?,"Hello all,

I’m a recent member of the group but have been dealing with severe depression (and some other physical limitations) for several years that has manifested in agoraphobic and hoarding behaviors. Because of this I struggle to keep up with tasks that require me to leave my apartment regularly like checking my mail or taking out my trash which the latter results in severe housekeeping issues that I have a hard time keeping up with. 

I had recently been thinking about posting a message on my buildings community app message board asking if anyone would be willing to pick up a bag or two of trash from outside my door once a week. I would gladly pay them for this assistance (I was thinking something like $20-25/week for one trip a week but would consider more if that seems too low, or I suppose if that seems excessive I can adjust accordingly). 

Would this be an odd thing to propose in this way?  It would continue until I could get my home and mental health back to a more manageable status.

1m7c71k,Everyone in my life fucking sucks.,"I am so fucking lonely, and have nobody. Everyone in my life is an actual piece of shit, and I have absolutely nobody. 

For starters, my best friend - the one person who I could trust on this world is an actual piece of shit and psychopath. Got arrested a few months ago for a horrific, violent and disgusting crime then used me as a vessel to traumatise and relive the crime. 

My parents are up my arse as usual, shouting at me for not getting good grades (I got an A instead of an A* in my mocks). Then when my school called them in to talk about the situation with my best friend, they acted all nice and swell in the meeting but bit my arse about it when I was home. 

My 'friends' in school have disappeared. Everyone thinks I should have been able to stop my best friend, everyone thinks I was involved and everyone is holding me responsible for his actions. 

My brain always flips between the extremes of hating people and loving people too. I feel like my best friend changed me and brought me into his world of darkness. I feel so naive and I hated life before him and I hate life even more after him. 

Simple stuff like school work is impossible, I want to apply to a top university like Oxford or Cambridge but I can't - my brain physically can't be bothered to do anything. I have so much coursework due for September and haven't done any of it. 

Everyone at school thinks I'm now milking it for attention, and then when I do the brave step of reaching out and explaining how shit I've felt before the big event and after the big event I get slapped with a 65 week waiting list. 

And I'm in this weird transition stage between child mental health services and adult mental health services where nobody seems to be able to give me the proper support. And I'm just so fucking lonely and I hate it all.

Stuff like gaming doesn't bring me joy. I bought a new switch 2 with the help of my sister hoping it would bring me joy - it didn't. And now I feel like an ungrateful bitch for doing so. I bought some new LEGO sets hoping id feel something - again, nothing. Nothing makes me happy anymore and I can't remember the last time I genuinely smiled and was happy. I was at a theme park the other day and everything feels so numbing, the rides don't feel as intense life feels so much grayer and darker. 

And I just don't know how I can continue like this. How can I get through year 13 like this, how can I survive, how can I be happy again. And it's such an awful mix of my prexisitng mental health conditions, and then my friend giving me PTSD. I don't know how to move on because moving on for me has always been shutting up about it and I can't do that anymore.

Hoje em dia infelizmente não é assim. Nos últimos dias, ela está me tratando com ódio e desprezo. Vive me dando patadas toda vez que falo com ela, ela vive falando que quer que ""eu saia com meu pai e deixe ela em paz""... eu tento fazer o máximo para reverter esse quadro dela, mas ela parece que ela tem coração de pedra. Ela tem demonstrado 0 compaixão, sensibilidade e amor por mim na última semana. Não aguento mais! Ja tentei de tudo. Eu choro, ela tem 0 empatia e me provoca ainda mais. Rezo, rezo, rezo, fiz até um ritual com oferenda e não adiantou de nada. Ela continua me tratando como se eu fosse o cocô do cavalo do bandido. O que fazer? Meu pai nem liga para mim.

1m797i1,Idea: remote community reading,"Uhm...hi.

I've been struggling with depressive episodes and anxiety for a long time. I had an idea and I've been doing this for a month and I want to share it. (Well I skipped going out one time, but I made a home-Café and did read, so that totally counted!)

I'm having problems with procrastination at home and I wanted to start reading more again. So I made a date with myself. I leave my home, go outside, find a nice cafe and sit there to read. Means at least talking to a waiter or waitress twice. Human contact. Easy right? Yeah well I needed a bit more motivation 😅

So I told people I would do this. And send them a pic of my drink and my book. I also got myself a paper notebook to keep track of my progress. Then my sister joined in. And then a colleague. We would send each other pics and then we would read each our own book.

So now every Wednesday evening, at 6 p.m., we have our bookclub. I live in germany and maybe posting this here may clash a bit with the exact time. But I want to invite you to join me. Feel free to tell someone close to you (so somebody will at least ask if you did this. This was a huge motivator for me.) and send them your pic. I would love to share my pic with you all. And maybe someone of you wants to respond with their pic. It probably makes sense at least posting your time zone or country with it. And maybe the book title in english.

I titled this idea ""bookclub with myself"". Mostly because I also take notes of the stuff I read. And because this idea was born out of looking for a bookclub and something always going wrong. So who cares if I read alone? I can just talk with myself if I write down my thoughts.

If you like the idea but it doesn't fit your needs: Choose a day that works better for you. If you have financial troubles, take a blanket and go to a park or a free space near your place. If you have problems to remember your bookclub date, use a calendar or an alarm. If outside is too much, stay home. 
Important is: Take a book and read. And while doing so: Make your space nice. Get your favourite drink, maybe some snack. Make yourself comfortable and be nice to yourself. Treat yourself. And share with at least one person: ""Hey, I hope you have a nice day. I am having my bookclub right now and treating myself. Look!"" And then you pat yourself on your back for doing something good for you. And start reading.

1m792tc,i am going to a psychiatrist for the first time,"Hi, I am going to a psychiatrist for the first time, and I am honestly kind of anxious coz I don't know what I am going to say. I went to a psychologist last month, and it was honestly so emotionally draining that I don't want to do that again. I decided not to continue with him because he was someone my family personally knew. Even though he was very sweet, it made me uncomfortable. After the session, I kept thinking that I had said too much and I shouldn’t have opened up like that. 

Lately, I haven't been able to work, and I just feel tired all the time. And I have no interest in living. My parents got to know about my struggles, so now they want me to seek help. first, they took me to the psychologist, and now, after seeing how I have been unable to take care of myself, they booked an appointment with the psychiatrist. 

Honestly, I sometimes think all this is just inside my head. Maybe this isn't even depression? Even though, yes, I have wanted to die for more than 3 years now. But, I  think that if I put my mind to it, I can get up from my bed, take a shower, and start doing the work I am supposed to do. But everything feels too difficult, and I constantly hate myself for not being able to do it.

I have recently graduated. I am supposed to be applying for jobs and finishing a research paper I need to publish. But whenever I think about doing these things, I feel like it will be worthless because this is not what I want to do, and I don't even know what I want to do. I feel so underconfident and lacking in courage, and I feel weak in front of others, which makes me think that I will not be able to succeed. I know this is because of my low self-esteem. 

I have started thinking if medication might help. Even during college, I felt like I didn’t want to live. I often felt stupid, but I still managed to attend classes and keep going because I had no choice. Now, after graduation, I feel like I’ve lost all that structure, and I just feel drained and exhausted. 

I know this rant is all over the place. But yeah, I don't know what is wrong with me, but something is. I just don't want to keep hating myself, and I just want to feel alive and happy. That is why I am going to the psychiatrist, but I don't know how I will be able to converse with them because blurting out all this feels so difficult, and I am already a reserved person. I'm worried that I might not be able to tell them my feelings properly, which I think is what happened with the psychologist I went to earlier.

1m7ic4l,Depression or is life just not the way you want it to be and you will always be sad,"I grew up in a broken family and struggled with anxiety and panic attacks from an early age on. The first time I thought of ending my life must have been at around 13, then 22 and in my end 20 and early 30. Throughout the years I realized that especially the relationship with my mom is very complex and different. Love is conditional and in case she has to chose between me and my brothers it’s them. I always thought and also because I have been told so by her it’s because I am an awful person and that’s the reason no one likes me in the family. I recently moved to a different country with my husband and became a mom. We decided to do this because in the past, any distance between me and my family improved our relationship and I could focus more on myself instead being an outsider in my family. My husband is caring, loving and the best thing that happened in my life. We are safe in terms of money, the apartment we live in and are very outgoing even with the baby and enjoy life although it can be tough with a baby and no family around.
I don’t have very close friends yet and most of them are mom friends. I’d say I easily get to know other people and are not shy, so there is a chance that I might build closer friendships in this new place we live. 
I am in therapy for 2,5 years and have improved a lot with a lot less dark thoughts and more self esteem and general positivity towards life. 

However I still struggle with days on which I feel I am a complete failure and my life is empty and sad. I force myself seeing the positive things but recently I had this thought that what if the thing I am struggling is not depression - but it’s just the fact that my life will never be the one I wish I had in the past or future and feeling depressed is the symptom. I won’t have happy memories of my family and they won’t be close to me in the future. I miss this so much and it is the only wish I have. That I didn’t had to move so far away from my close friends and could spend time with family members that actually like me. I feel with moving away I’ve repeated history for my daughter and will struggle with loneliness my whole life. People say you build your own family but kids are not the same missing brothers or parents. It really frightens me because before I met my husband there was always the dark escape from all of it and know I don’t have this choice anymore but I don’t know how my life will ever get light and without these very dark thoughts anymore.",1,0,1753298131.0,depression,vanbera,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m7ic4l/depression_or_is_life_just_not_the_way_you_want/,2025-07-25T09:58:07.309525

1m75ohk,Down,"Hiya guys, first time posting here, it might be a longer, jumbled one, you have my apologies.

Just want to say im not thinking of doing anything, I just talk roughly

None of this is proven or scientific,  it's just how my life seems to have gone.

I don't even know where to start, i think I've been depressed since I was a very young, i never had hopes or dreams, like when I was asked what I wanted to be i had to  make it up.

My life has been a series of mini addictions with an overarching constant addiction which is alcohol, so for example I read 7 books in January/ February and none since. On a normal year I'd have been drinking too but im really trying to quit this year. 

I've never had any get up and go, i can lie on my sofa for days (i mean I work daily but other times I do). I've looked up how to get motivation and some say things like ' give it 5 mins of doing something and you'll carry on' i do it and have 5 mins of hating it and wishing i was dead. Same with walking in the country, it doesn't clear my head, I just walk around hating myself over perceived wrong things I've done in the past, which aren't really anything tbh.

The addictions i spoke about earlier I can't really find anymore, I don't really enjoy anything anymore, i just scroll on my phone.

Im not lonely, i go to the gym twice a week with friends, have a decent family around me and regularly see friends. I just don't care, if it wasn't for other people's energy with me I wouldn't get in touch

There's probably more but it's not in my head atm.

Sorry for the ramble, this is the first time I've wrote anything about my mh except for in the stopdrinking sub, I think I need to tackle both things at the same time which seems a chore

Take care

1m7g9s7,Lost,"I am really going through a difficult spell in my life. I have been fighting depression and anxiety since my college years and it has came back worse than ever the past 3 months at 32 years old. I try to tell myself how grateful i should be for parents that love me, a fiancé that loves me unconditionally and a job (barely holding on to it) that pays well. I also have tons of support from friends. 

My fiancé and I moved cities for her job in May and i started to spiral after. I realized how inept i was at taking care of our first house. No idea how to fix things around the house, yard work, and being the so called man of the house. I’m also recognizing a lot of the mistakes i have made at work over the past 4 years and do not know how to reconcile. (Invoicing errors) and has made me feel completely worthless. I now have a tough time taking care of basic chores and have lost over 10 pounds the last month. I have deleted all social media and have self isolated. My fiancé is planning the wedding and i feel awful because im scared im going to lose my job and be an awful husband. 

I’ve always felt like I’ve been a tick slower than the rest of my friends and colleagues in school and work. I tend to overthink and  over analyze every situation which has made my life hell since the first time i experienced these feelings in college. I’m extremely unorganized, lose things constantly, and have trouble presenting myself in public. All i look forward to is being able to fall asleep and be away from all this. I have scheduled an assessment for an ADHD screening which I’m hopeful this will provide some clarity to all the self criticism and overthinking I’ve experienced in my life. Do you all have any suggestions on how to break this cycle and do my symptoms sound characteristic of ADHD? I’m just looking for some sort of clarity of the mental torture I’ve been through the past 10 years ",1,0,1753293467.0,depression,Appropriate_Self_725,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m7g9s7/lost/,2025-07-25T09:58:07.309525
1m779nh,this is rock bottom. at least to me,"hi yall remember me? i came here a couple of mouths ago to tell yall that i was about to fuck up my exams cuz i couldnt study enough and it was causing me depression.

well my grades came out yesterday. i expected them to be bad but not like this. i was hoping they would enable me to study low level architecture but now im not even sure ill make it.

i tried using a blade on my skin for the first time yesterday. but as expected i got too scared to actually make a cut. but im still thinking about hurting myself in any way possible. i might try again tonight. 

i even tried asking for help. i tried sitting and talking with my mom. i told her i need a therapist. and guess what she did. she got mad at me for being sad and angry and for crying. she didnt even try to comfort me. not even once. and she got extra mad at me because i wanted to close the door to my own room. like what the fuck does that have to do with anything right now??

i realise i sound like a little girl arguing with her parent but i really am tired. im tired of everything. tired of this world. tired of myself even. i hate everything and everyone. i hate school. i hate grades. i hate my friends. i hate my family. i hate the fact that i cant change the past. i hate this stupid country that im force to live in. i hate that i dont have enough money to fix things. i could've gotten into a good college if I had the money. fuck college, i could've started my own business without needing a degree. my life would've been content like that. 

i wish i could just run far away from everything ive ever known. start a new life, with a new name. carefree. i wouldnt have to worry about my status in society. or the way people judge. i hate humans. why did we have to put up such stupid systems? why is a person's value based on a number in their report card or their paycheck? why cant we live normally? i dont understand. i truly dont. humans werent supposed to live like this. lives full of stress and misery. 

i want to go back to being a kid. no stress. no pain. no expectations. just carefree fun all day everyday. god i wish that was a possibility.

im just so tired of living. i want to go to sleep right now and never wake up again. i dont want to be a part of this world anymore. or any world at all. but i cant. i have to stay here. im forced to live in this society, endure this hell, all because they deemed me not smart enough for their stupid colleges. ive always been smart though. i dont know what happened to me.

i know im being hella negative right now. but i just cant think about anything positive in my situation. all im thinking about right now is just running away. but i cant do that realistically. im not american. i cant just hop onto a random bus and rent an apartment somewhere far away from everything ive ever known. i dont even know if this is a real thing people do or if it's just movie fantasy. either way, it wont stop it from sounding like a nice idea right about now.

i dont know where im going with this post, i guess im just ranting. i think im just seeking the comfort I couldn't get from strangers online. anyway, thiss has become quite the long rant. i know most people dont read this much, so if you're still here, thank you for hearing me out.

I never get why everyone’s always laughing like psychotic hyenas because if it’s about a joke, it’s not funny. The only funny thing around is why I’m still existing. 
I know I sound like a miserable grouchy party pooper low life which is true, but I’ve been feeling hollow for so long that I forgot what it’s like to feel any sort of joy. It’s becoming such a foreign concept that seeing anyone happy feels weird because who can feel that at a time like this? What kind of superhuman ability is this?
I think my brain has malfunctioned and that’s why it can’t comprehend whatever all these functional brains can do. And they don’t get me either because I’m constantly been looked down and undervalued for being unhappy, emotional and tired and that I should ‘start being happy and full of love because that’s all a human needs to survive.” Well, if that’s the way, being human is not for me because I get none of that.

I'm 16f, who's overweight and an eldest daughter in an South Asian household. If ur a daughter in an South Asian household, ur the manager of the family and a literal doctor and a caretaker. Im recently done with my exams and the results were out. I prob passed everything and only failed math which means I have to retake it. My mom was so disappointed in me and when my younger sis told about her marks she was comparing it indirectly. Before every exam, she would either scream on me bcz I wasn't doing my job properly or have a fight w my dad or, say things like ' ohh u have get 100 % in ur math exam cuz we got u in a tutoring ( which didn't help) plus we're immigrants. Learning and doing math in french is already hard for me. They doesn't even know what subject im doing or not. Recently my parents fought , and the reason was that my dad spend his own me time after my mom goes to sleep, which disturbs her CZ she can't sleep alone. Plus in the morning while they have coffee, he looks at his phone all the time. My dad and me, WE were close once, he used to complain over mom how she behave how she orders around how she place her victim card. So when they were having fight, it got so worse that I started to scream and was like my mental health and my weight is getting worse bcz of y'all's fight. My younger sis cry at night J's bcz of y'all so stop fighting. Legit I was right all along and my mom was like hon it's alr it's ok don't cry and then we 3 ( our dad was sleeping) had a convoy and found out our prbs. So when we were talking about it w our dad he was disappointed but he accepted his faults. From the next day, my mom is like, you should also see your prbs u shouldn't be a bitch . I am doing dishes, cleaning and organizing the whole ficking house all day long and later when I'm J's expressing myself I'm being a bitch?  Plus I also told her she should stop a lil hit of ordering stuff around and do her job, now she's like oh it's alr I don't need to do it cuz u told me to do my job..

1m762m9,Effexor Withdrawal. Help,"19 YO female diagnosed with depression and anxiety as of 2022. My first major panic attack at school I was sent to the hospital and prescribed 37.5mg of venlafaxine. First dose, fine. Doc told me I should up the dose. After a few weeks, fine. Doc told me I should up the dose again. After a few weeks, fine. Fine until I missed one tablet because I ran out and NEVER got told about withdrawal symptoms or Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome. Ended up hospitalised after having episodes of non-stop vomiting. Stayed there from 7pm til 2am with an IV, the vomiting and nausea continued the next day. Afraid to ever completely miss a dose ever again, I continued to take 150mg of Effexor without fail until this year. I was done. I am done. I am sick of being a slave to this medication that makes me feel 100x worse than my depression alone when I forget to take a dose at the exact time every morning. If I am so much as an hour late I feel light-headed and nauseous. God forbid I go a whole work day without access to the Effexor, I’m insufferable by the afternoon.

I’ve tapered off the last few months going from 75mg to 37.5mg and now I’m off it on day 2 and now I feel like shit. Total shit: I’m hunched over a toilet seat, dry heaving right now as I am writing this. I cried and cried at the dinner table by myself eating plain fish because I didn’t want any of my family around me. I didn’t cry because of the fish (I love fish, including my pet fishies), I cried because of the pain I am going through because of this fucking medication. I cried because I can’t enjoy my favourite meals without them having to come back up as soon as I’m finished with them. Saw my fave doc today and she prescribed me some anti-nausea meds which… Didn’t work.

I just feel so betrayed by the (Aussie) healthcare system because absolutely nobody told me this would be an issue… It feels like they fed me the meds and said ‘yes! This will fix all your MH problems!’ without warning me about the long list of side effects and do-nots. 

Apparently this is just the start. Good luck to me I guess, but I really do wish I could just end it all the easy way. I don’t care for the length of the emotional symptoms, I have become good at managing them as well as my boyfriend who supports me through my meltdowns. But someone please, who has gone through this, tell me the physical symptoms get better soon. I am not someone who likes to feel sick, but I absolutely CANNOT stand being nauseous and vomiting.

1m717h5,Playing a Character.,"In my day to day life I am not myself. I distort myself to appear sociable but I am not. I appear kind, helpful, but I'm not. 

When I'm by myself, that's when the true version of me comes out. A confused child pretending to be an adult. I am an introvert egomaniac who only cares how I appear to others. I am always seeking validation but hate when there are eyes on me or murmurs mentioning my name. It's like I am a walking contradiction. 

I think the only thing scarier than people seeing through my facade, is someone actually seeing me at my most vulnerable, someone seeing me as my authentic self. So that's why I never let my guard down. And you would think someone so obsessed with self image would probably be well kept and decently built, but I am probably in the worst shape of my life. I get self conscious about it and it only reenforces my funny, friendly facade. It's a bubble to keep people at an arms length or further. 

I don't have goals or ambitions. I just have tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that. Just praying that one of these days, the gears inside of my brain will finally click into position and I will confidently know how to handle every problem and situation life throws my way without even a pause or worry. Until then I'm just continuing to play this character.",7,0,1753249549.0,depression,HugoHuey,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m717h5/playing_a_character/,2025-07-25T09:58:07.309525
1m75epl,"For the first time in my entire life, I think I am “Depressed”","Day to day life is is always extremely high or extremely low. I’ve been out of a 5 year relationship  for 8 months now, and it still hurts. She’s got another man and just found out from a coworker she’s pregnant. I don’t hate her. I don’t want to be with her, yet I feel like I can’t breathe if I ever see her in public. We don’t speak. Idk why I care, I don’t even want to but I always do. I’m certain her and her friends hate me now. I really don’t like that, I don’t speak bad or contact them at all, or her for that matter. I’ve always known since the day we broke up we’d never work out again. I didn’t try. I still don’t regret it (I think) but it all hurts still like a lot. More than I’ve ever dealt with emotion wise.

I’m alone. I live by myself now. 2 bed room apartment with 2 cats that keep me from completely becoming numb. I don’t have family that I call “family”, only my younger sister who has a family of her own. I don’t have a mom or dad that I’ve spoken to in over a decade. I feel beyond isolated, and while it’s not something I hated at first, it’s eating at me slowly.

I’ve never had the guts to hurt myself. I don’t want to hurt. But I don’t also don’t want to be sad and feel like shit 3/4th of the time. It sucks.

1m6s4c6,I have never been this bad. I’m 34. I’m past the point of saving and my body is falling apart.,"How the fuck am I supposed to even live? I have newly confirmed Lymes disease, diagnosed CPTSD, spinal stenosis, degenerative disk disorder, tilted sacrum and spine and worsening late diagnosed scoliosis, spinal narrowing. I wake up and exist. I don’t live. I live in pain. I have NO support system. I have no one to help me and I’m a mother and that makes the guilt ten times worse because he deserves so much better than this. Truly-  he’s the only thing that keeps me here. And I know it’s getting bad because I’m starting to think that my presence is worse. That prolonging this is only going to make it harder for him. I have already been married and divorced, am still trying to recover from all that and a terrible trauma bond afterwards. So much emotional and sexual abuse in the last 3 years. I have known nothing but abuse and because I grew up with an emotionally immature covert narc mother, I attribute control with love. I don’t even know what love is. I thought someone finally “saw” me the other day. And they said I was “too much” literally. The one thing I have been trying to unteach myself my whole life, how can I be too much when I internalize all my pain? How was I too much when I was happy the entire time - because my art held sadness and it seemed my head was always “busy”… what the fuck? 
And anyone who wants me just wants to fuck me and that just hurts more because it literally would cause me to flare up for days and days. My tailbone is sticking out. I’m finally skinny. Wow. Never imagined I’d be 109 lbs. and I have a whole fucking house that is months behind, a new car that’s going to be repoed. I wasted my 401k on empty promises. I can barely move. I have no joy. I have no friends. I have no one to laugh with. I feel like I’m a terrible mother because I’m not able to take him to do all these fun things. I’m financially, emotionally, and physically crumbling and when my sons at his dads, I pace around the house and cry. Sobs that sound like dying animals. I go into a room and forget why I even went in there. The days are just days. I have been fighting so fucking hard. I’ve always fought so hard. And I have nothing left in me. I seriously don’t. I absolutely understand how easy it would be to end it all. I’d rather not exist. But I can’t hurt my baby. But I already am. He needs a stable home - and I don’t even know what the fuck I’m doing. Pretty soon I’ll have no phone, internet, car, no way to even attempt to make money. I’ve been trying to sell items, I printed out and documented everything to prove that I’m not just “not working” I am struggling to STAY ALIVE - and I’m just completely unseen. I don’t even think it would be a big deal to anyone if I was gone except my son and abusive parents. I know it wouldn’t. I was told by a “best friend” to get my head out of my ass when she knows NOTHING of my life. Has she been around? Has she seen me every night at 4 am waking up dying to take the next allowed dose of Motrin and crying in pain with a heating pad until it subsides enough to either sleep another hour or just get up and go on with the stupid day. The stupid days that I’ve spent printing out documents, trying to get help, screaming for help. I can’t save myself at this point. I am too weak.

1m751y9,Switching psychiatrists,"Hi. I’m not sure if this is okay to post on here but I need advice. I abruptly stopped taking my meds around early march. I impulsively threw them out. But before I stopped taking them, I was going to psychiatrists’ office since after my hospitalization for an attempt.

I never really liked the place. Every time I went, I had a different doctor & they never really heard me out when I’d say I was getting worse. The wait time was horrible & they always forgot to send my prescriptions after my appointment so I’d be off my meds for a few days every time.

Anyway— I’ve been thinking of going back on my meds, but I don’t want to go back to the same place. What’s the process to switching psychiatrists? Do I find a new doctor and then request for my records to be sent to the new doctor? 

Edit: I’d also like to add that I’ve never had or have gone to a therapist before. That’s something I definitely want to try but I’ve never gone through that process of getting one, so advice in finding one would be a appreciated :’) ",3,2,1753264445.0,depression,kittnag,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m751y9/switching_psychiatrists/,2025-07-25T09:58:07.309525

1m7ca4g,Is it really laziness?,"I (M33 adhd and autism) live with my mom, my brother, and his wife.  Recently, after putting it off for months, I took my dog to the vet for a skin condition.  As I was instructing my mom on how to give the medicine to my dog, my brother‘s wife, stuck her nose in my business, and went on some lecture about responsibility or whatever.  When I told my brother about this, he pretty much took her side and talk about how since it was my dog I’m the one who should be taking care of it.

I’ll admit this is a fair point, and things would’ve been fine if he left it there, but as he often does, he turns everything into some sort of lecture. I don’t remember the whole argument, but other than me having to take care of my dog, he also brings up the fact that sometimes I occasionally forget to do a chore or two, and I have to be re-reminded to do it.

Well, let me share my side of the story.  The reason why I delegated most of my dog duties to my mom is because I have to work in order to pay the sky high rent they’re charging me and a hefty monthly car insurance bill I have to pay.  And when I come home from work, I am usually exhausted and I need at least 20 minutes to decompress and recharge.

Before I get a bunch of comments saying “why didn’t you do this or that?”, I should point out I’ve had a very rocky year job-wise.  In January, I was fired from my job, I spent the better part of two months trying to find employment again.  I eventually did until I was laid off from that job only after two months.  While both the first and current unemployment periods occurring, they refused to take any financial mercy on me.  You lost your job and your mental health is at a low point?  Fuck you pay us!*  Our mental health is messed up too, and we still work.  That’s why I put off taking my dog to the vet.

But as I thought about what my brother said, he was right about me forgetting to do the daily chores around the house.  Well I already gave it away earlier, but what with me dealing with two job losses in one year, it caused my depression to worsen, causing me to be more forgetful and maybe even less energetic.  I find my self doing things slowly, and the bare minimum.

As of the writing of this, I am currently looking for a job and have been doing delivery side gigs just to get by.  In fact, that was the “work” I was referring to.

*For the record, they never said that, but that what it feels like.  If I confront them about this, they’ll spew out some kind of convoluted bullshit about how I am lazy or whatever and that they are too went through hardship therefore my suffering is invalid.",1,4,1753284425.0,depression,rtjy,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m7ca4g/is_it_really_laziness/,2025-07-25T09:58:07.309525

I've got no friends, no SO, no kids, no job, and paying rent I can't afford. I can't get hired because I can't seem to answer job interview questions correctly or I'm just not as qualified.
     I had a difficult childhood and chose wrong methods to cope in the form of escapism. Pretty soon that turned into a lifestyle of escapism without developing discipline among other character-building skills. My folks say they want to help with finances while I continue to apply for jobs, but I can't let them do that again. They're both retired and should not be helping me at all; it's not right.
     I know I should be trying to think positively and just keep going, but my state of mind is buried at rock bottom with a ball and chain to the point where I legitimately don't know how to do that. There are finer details as to why I am the way I am but I'd have to make multiple posts for that.

     I know it won't help, but I did find a fraction of a fraction of relief to write it down.

I just don’t understand why good friends make plans, and then cancel with no real good reason. Like my sister, who told me she was going to visit for a week. I was so excited. I cleaned, cooked, shopped for her favorite foods, and planned activities I knew she would like( I also paid for these). Four days before she is to arrive, l she calls to say she can’t come.No real reason, she just can’t. I asked if everything was ok, and what was going on. She said nothing, she just can’t come. I explained about how disappointed  I was, and how I had prepared for her visit. Now things are strained, and I can’t seem to get past it. Other people have made plans, and canceled too.

1m71yf7,I don’t even know what’s going on but I feel like I’m rotting in my own body. (partial vent),"Pretty much what the title says. I 17(F), suffer from; severe social anxiety, generalized anxiety, persistent depressive disorder, chronic PTSD, ADHD, and (what is presumed to be by my therapist and psych) Borderline personality disorder. About 9 months or so ago my partner of almost 2 years left me which left me confused and even more so after trying to at least work out what happened. After that I started suspecting that I had BPD since a few people in my family have it, I’ve been on a medication for it which does help but not the actual diagnosis which alone stresses me out. Since then my uncle who’s more of a friend almost died 2 times (this is unfortunately a normalcy because of the amount of health issues he has). And we now know that my other uncle who’s more of actually is diagnosed with BPD is dying. And today I think I finally figured out that my friend aren’t actually my friends.

From the time I was little I had to practically raise myself so it’s hard for me to recognize and ultimately feel loved so after finally having that for the previous 2 years my partner leaving me absolutely shattered that leading me to spiral out of control trying to figure out what or if any of it was real. I’ve tried to commit many times before but none were successful obviously so it all just feels pointless to try so even though it’s not a preferred escape I just feel completely trapped on top of alone. (I have been to the MH a few times but that also never works for me.)

I’m just wondering if anyone has any advice or similar situations like mine.

1m73fkj,My boyfriend is leaving me and I want to kill myself,"I (18f) have been with my boyfriend (18m) for almost two years. We’ve gone through so much together and even though we’re so toxic and abuse the hell out of each other I can’t imagine being alone again.

 We used to have such perfect nights getting high together where it felt like we were the only two people in the world. We’re ’on a break’ but had sex today and I thought we were fine but I’m so tired of the mixed messages because I just can’t stop panicking. I’ve barely gotten any sleep these past few nights because I can’t stop crying and hyperventilating. 

I only have 2-3 other close friends and even though he says we would still be friends if we really did break up for good, I just have no idea what I would do. When we broke up once before all I did was drink and cry. My mom and stepdad are terrible to be around
most of the time and the college I’m going to in a month or so was nowhere near my top choice and I don’t want to go there anymore but I have nowhere else to go. 

I don’t know who I’m going to talk to anymore. I don’t know who would put up with me like he did. His family loves me and I can’t imagine not being around them anymore. They accept me more than my own family at times. The thought of being with another man makes me sick and just suicidal. Same goes for imagining him being happy with another girl and seeing the smile that he used to have with me.

I haven’t been this depressed since December, but at least back then I had him. I haven’t been taking my antidepressants for months. I’ve been depressed for 6+ years and gone through several therapists and psychiatrists. I used to at least have hope that things might get better but now I feel that it’s too late for me. I’ve attempted suicide before but I really think if I do again, it would need to be the final time.

It worked really well and I was so happy that I started seeing someone.

Lately, I’ve started having suicidal thoughts again. On and off. It’s worse than I’ve ever had. I plan it better than before. 

But the difference this is that I totally feel emotionless about it. I want to know if this is just how it goes? If someone else experienced it like this? Is this still just suicidal ideation or should I feel more concerned?

1m768qu,I'm going to lose my mind in this house.,"I can't take it anymore. I can't leave without money, and I'm getting 800 dollars a month maximum at my job since they cut my hours. I'm trying to look for another, but nowhere is hiring. I don't even think they're looking at applications. 

My grandmother has been living with us for over a year now against the house's wishes, because she wasn't happy in the nursing home after she had a stroke. She was only going to stay for a month before going home, and she's been past fully recovered without any progress in moving her back home. She is miserable, cruel, unhygenic, and nothing we do to improve her time with us is enough for her. When my mother was alive a year ago, she was ridden with cancer and couldn't do any work -- but grandma didn't care. She would call her names like bitch, ungrateful, asshole, etc. because my mother and I would try to keep her from continuing unhealthy behaviors that led to the stroke. It was sickening seeing her constantly order my mother around while she could barely walk, and my mom telling me that I shouldn't chew her out ab her cancer because she didn't want to 'hurt her feelings'. Then a few months later, her condition got worse, and she didn't even want her mother in the hospital because she knew she was going to be hurt, meanwhile grandma was still talking shit about her own daughter while she was dying. She passed a few months ago, rest her soul. 

I don't care if she's being cruel to me specifically, my main problem is her being unhygenic. She will go to the bathroom and not wash her hands, then get shit all over the dishes, the counter, the fridge, on the walls, etc. She will not change her diaper when it's full, and keeps putting them in the kitchen garbage so the whole house smells like a port-a-potty. That ontop of the dog's area is disgusting, but the dog can't help if he can't go outside and has to use his wee-wee pad. She will step in the dog's area and trail shit all throughout the house. She will cook and leave a mess all over the counter, though we have told her countless times that she's not allowed to because she's left the gas on multiple times, and left fires on. Now because of her habits ontop of my father's, we have roaches. 

I spent 2 weeks cleaning and putting down poison to control them, and it is finally to a point that I don't see them daily. Thank god. But now, we have ants because she spills food everywhere, and eats in her bed instead of the table. We usually get ants in the summer, but not this bad. We'll usually see them by a single windowsill because they like my mom's plants, but that's it. BUt this year, they're literally everywhere. All over the floor scavenging, in every room including the kitchen. 

Now just an hour ago i was getting ready for work, I found a bedbug on the wall of our kitchen I genuinely don't know what to do. I keep telling my family we need to get her out somewhere immediately, but it seems like nothing is happening. I gew up in multiple infestations, and I can't go through another one. Seeing bugs alone are a trigger for me, and I can't do it anymore. Not to mention the only people that were able to help already moved out, but I don't have the finances to move. I can't even find a job that'll pay enough for rent, and it sickens me. I can't escape, and this house is just falling into worse ruin.

I just have had this disgusting sense of dread in my body and I’ve been feeling this way for a while now and it comes and goes in waves almost. I think about the future and how honestly there is just so much evil in the world right now and everyone is just so mean to eachother and I just don’t think life will ever be like how it was before. Maybe it’s a mix of fears of global warming, politics, family and many other factors. But when I think about all this and just how life isn’t gonna be the same I tend to slip into day dreaming and feeling a lot of nostalgia to the point my heart physically hurts. I think about my childhood in the 2000s and just how less technology was involved and people were much more disconnected? Life felt almost easier at that time? Thinking about the future and also the past has just brought me into some sort of depression and makes me feel like giving up. Feeling like there’s no point especially with how society and just everything going on in the world. But if anyone could give me some advice? How do you deal with nostalgia? How do you deal with that gut wrenching feeling? or even just if you’ve felt the same recently I think it would make me feel a little bit less alone.

1m7611e,My mum dislikes me and it is really pushing me to the edge,"Just as the title says I think my mom dislikes me or atleast does not like me as much as my brother.I have noticed this since a long time that she has always treated my older brother better than me.I also thought about what could be the possible reason for this ,maybe it is internalized misogyny or maybe because he was her first child.

Anyway my brother was coddled by her while I was neglected constantly but thankfully due to that I became more independent than him.But the thing due to this constant mistreatment I found myself alone and isolated within my own family and house.Dad is my only support but he is mostly outside because of work.

My brother and my mother constantly gang upon me and I have no one to help me out.But when I do tell it her face about her partiality and she in turn gaslights me that the reason she prefers my brother is because he would never speak back to her the way I do.How would someone speak back when they have been treated nicely their entire life.

Recently,I wanted to go out with my friends and I am person who doesn't usually go out,maybe twice or thrice in a whole year.I needed some cash so I asked her for it and she was straight up refused.The thing is my brother keep on going on various outings with his friends often and she doesn't mind giving how much ever he wants.I did not ask my dad because I didn't want to burden him with extra expenses as he is the one takes care every little expense of mine and this month earlier I had gone on some cloth shopping so I had finished up the cash that my dad gave.Also I don't mind if she refused to give me the cash. It was more or so the way she told it,she was pretty harsh about it and said that I have no reason to give any sort money to you.I gave up and did not out with my friends,an outing which I badly wanted to go.

Now there have been times where my mum has cared for me but for most part it mostly my brother>>>>me for her.I am struggling so much mentally because of this issue.Also moving out is not an option as I am still quite young and my country doesn't have part time jobs.So I will have to stick around with this situation till I finish my education and get a job.But the is question how much more can I tolerate?

I can't tell them about my problems, because they'll take me to therapy. What if they see me differently then? All I want is to be loved by someone. It infuriates me when I see couples downtown holding hands, or my friends and peers talking about how much they love their girlfriends. It infuriates me that they have with ease what I dream and daydream about, what I yearn for every second of every day. I fall asleep every night fantasizing about resting in the arms of someone who truly loves and cares for me. What if someone loves me someday? Will I be alive to see it happen? Will I have overcome my addiction then? My dream is to have a child someday, but I'll probably have killed myself before that ever happens. Let's say I got what I wanted. Would I finally be happy? No one can love a person like me. I can't show genuine happiness anymore. I wear a mask when I interact with people so they suspect nothing is wrong. My friends don't even talk to me anymore.

Considering everything that’s happened throughout my life already i don’t even know how to feel about things properly I’m not even past 25. Don’t get me wrong I was no saint growing up.“Hurt people-HURT People” is what someone always use to tell me.  But I was also a child. I was better thanks my my 2 pilers of a support system but The spiraling thoughts never stop. And my moods of completely feeling everything or nothing at all never goes away and quite frankly in moments like these where huge bombs fall and all the stress just adds up I wonder if it was even worth it to stick around. I know everyone could survive without me.

1m7234r,Working 11 hours shifts as an 18 year old,"I really on everything I love wanna kill myself because of this job. Aint nobody want me there anyway because I'm retarded. And these slimy greasy motherfuckers really changed my job 3 weeks in because I asked if there was anything else to do. 

Like this was not an invitation to just throw me in a department I know nothing about, and if I really had to guess,they did it too make me wanna quit. 

Bunch of bitter hardened 30 to 40 year olds who can't find a better job so they work here, come in at 6:30 and supposed to leave at 5. 

And you know that's real funny, we ALWAYS clock in at 6:30 on the dot or before that, but we never get off exactly at 5, they really like to milk that labor as much as they can. 

Also I can't do that, I don't get my license until October 16th, so I'm relying on my aunt too take me and pick me up. And she gets there at like 5:15 everyday but theres a chance some days we have too work til 6. 6 to 6, who the fuck does that, 15 year old me would never do this. 



There are some really nice people there though, most people wave and ask how my day was. The Nicaraguan ladies are nice and some of my coworkers from my old department are nice. But everyone else has a stick up there ass about me,  it's actually 2 people a mother and a daughter, they think they run the place, the daughter actually called me retarded yesterday, and just in general they're mean. 

The mom looks like the grey alien in the ""we are ready for the next step of the operation"" meme, and  the daughter looks like if developing a pill habit in your 20s was a person, and top of some serious anemia.

1m750nv,Ich hoffe es passt hier rein,"Update: Es wird schlimmer

Eigentlicher post ist in Beziehungen. Hoffe es ist okay das update und den post nochmal zu schreiben vielleicht gibt es neuen Input. Ich bin wirklich verzweifelt weil es schlimmer statt besser wird. Ich möchte nur noch weg. 

Bin verzweifelt, ihre Affäre wird nicht langweilig. Ich habe alles versucht. 

Hallo zusammen, vorweg entschuldigt bitte grammatikalische Fehler hab halt Entzündung im Hirn 😅🫣 

Ich brauche wirklich einen Rat. Leider kein witz. Zur Situation: 

Ich (m36) bin leider schwer an MS erkrankt (seit 2018 3 Wochen vor der Hochzeit ), wodurch ich meine „Ehepflichten“ nicht mehr erfüllen kann leider(kann weder knien, noch oben liegen oder auf dem rücken durch meine Spa*tiken)

Ich bin seit 18! Jahren mit meiner Frau (37) zusammen und wir hatten seid wir zusammen sind nie viel sex (alle 4-6 ,dann nur 5 minuten), da sie nie wollte, was ich akzeptiert habe weil ich sie liebe. Habe mich wirklich nie beschwert. 

Dann gab es zwei schlimme Schicksalsschläge leider 2011 den tod ihrer tollen omi🥲 und 2023 den tod ihrer mama. 2011 wollte sie mich ca 1,5 jahre nichtmal küssen, was für mich auch kein Problem war weil ich, keine Ahnung wohl nen netter kerl bin. Hab nie was gesagt. Auch 2023 nicht als es noch Schlimmer war, was ich verstehen kann. Bin ein sehr sensibler typ und es tut mir unendlich für sie leid. 

Schade ist halt das sie schon immer wütend statt traurig ist. Also wenn ich verletzt bin weine ich viel und versuche das durch reden zu klären. Sie ist da eher der „Kerl“ rumschreien auf jeden sauer sein und unverhältnismäßig meckern auch wenn ich neutral gesehen nichts gemacht habe. 

Durch meine Krankheit und vor allem die schlimmen schmerzen (nicht mal Morphin hilft) bin ich sehr zurückgezogen geworden und oft traurig/depressiv.  Dazu kommt ich Will auch aus Angst eigentlich nie das Haus verlassen. Bin eigentlich 1,90 groß wog früher 110kg und hab leidenschaftlich kung fu gemacht. War zwar immer speckig aber konnte mich verteidigen sag ich mal und nun mit 65 kg  und im Rollstuhl wehrlos quasi. 

Ich versuche aber jeden Tag mich ihr zur liebe durch die Angst zu kämpfen, nicht aufzugeben (was ich auch oft will aber niemals mache) und sachen zu unternehmen obwohl ich nur drinnen sein will. Seit 2 jahren fahren wir 2x im Jahr in ein tolles hotel um ein wenig rauszukommen is nicht weit weg aber die Umgebung ist ne komplett andere im bergischen land. 

Jetzt waren wir vor 2 monaten dort zu unserem 18. jahrestag. Is Nicht weit weg da ich durch meine beine nicht lange im Auto sitzen kann. War echt schön, außer das ich natürlich wieder nicht mal einen Kuss bekommen habe. Ich verstehe es so ein nichtmal halben Mann würde ich auch nicht küssen wollen 🥲. Hab mich aber zusammenreißen und bin trotz Angst und schmerzen mit ihr an die bar um zu zeigen das ich mir mühe gebe. Für mich mit der generalisierten Angststörung echt ein großer schritt

Und als wir zurück waren ging es los. Sie fragte ob sie meinen … mal wieder haben darf weil es ihr fehlt. Ich sag „klar kein ding der funktioniert ja noch“ und zur not ne pille auch wenn die in kombi mit meinen anderen Medikamenten echt gefährlich sind. Aber ich tue alles um sie glücklich zu machen. 

Ich hab meine Antwort nicht mal abgeschickt da kommt von ihr „was würdes du sagen wenn ich was mit einem anderen hätte NUR körperlich natürlich“. Das hatte ich ihr bereits  vor 3-4 Jahren angeboten hatte aus Respekt vor ihren Bedürfnissen. Damals sagte sie immer ich sei verrückt und soll sowas nicht mal denken. Tja umso geschockter war ich aber hab sofort verständnisvoll reagiert und gesagt das wir in nem club oder dem Internet jemand suchen. 

Das war natürlich total schlimm von mir es muss ja jemand sein den sie kennt. Ihr vorarbeiter auf den ich immer eifersüchtig war schon damals. Ein Schlag ins Gesicht. Sie hat mich so lange überredet bis ich dem zugestimmt habe. Sie hat mir tolle Sachen versprochen das sie ausgeglichener is weniger schreit und mich weniger zur Sau macht. Hab mich manipulieren lassen und ja gesagt. Sie hat mich am Anfang immer gelobt wie männlich und toll und groß es ist das zu erlauben aus liebe zu ihr und sowas. Hat versprochen es nicht zu übertreiben und mich nich zu vernachlässigen und nicht zu oft etc. 

Tja in 2 Monaten 8! mal. Die ersten 2 male hat sie mit mir noch rumgemacht danach wahrscheinlich damit ich die klappe halte. Aber seit Wochen nix mehr. Die Küsschen sind schöner und Schmatzer geworden und nich wie bei einem freund aber trotzdem sonst nix. Nur noch Augen für ihn. Wenn ich ihr schreibe is sie genervt hat sogar aus das ich sehe wann sie online war. Aber hängt den ganzen tag am handy um ihm zu schreiben. 

Update: Mittlerweile kommt er regelmäßig vorbei, heute ist der Todestag ihrer Mami und anstatt mit mir zeit zu verbringen damit ich für sie da sein kann will sie nur mit ihm Zeit verbringen. Ich erlaube so viel gebe so viel Freiheiten und es wird trotzdem ausgenutzt und ich werde mit Füßen getreten. Sie verspricht immer es wird weniger es wird sich beruhigen und weniger aber genau das Gegenteil passiert. Sie fährt eine stunde früher zur arbeit kommt später zurück und ist nur noch mit ihm. 

Es geht immer 4-5 std und wenn ich sie anspreche woher das auf einmal kommt sagr sie nur „weiß ich nicht ich genieße das“


Wenn ich frage warum sie noch mit mir verheiratet is kommt das sie mich liebt. Aber das kann doch keine liebe sein. Ich verstehe es einfach nicht. 

Mittlerweile möchte ich mich einfach nur neu verlieben um hier raus zu kommen aber ich schaffe es nicht alleine leider. Vielleicht fühlt sich eine nette single Lady angesprochen und möchte mir schreiben. 

Wenn ich abspreche das es mich verletzt kommt nur „sei froh ich kanns auch heimlich machen du kanns eh nich raus“ oder „ich kann auch wieder anfangen zu meckern/schimpfen“ 

Das klingt wahrscheinlich echt lächerlich und ich bin ein totaler looser aber ich weiß nicht weiter. Ich bin abhängig quasi da das haus klimatisiert und barrierefrei umgebaut wurde. Ich kann nicht weg. Aber hab auch niemanden zum reden. 


Ich hätte gerne jemand zum reden. Als eine art „Gegenstück“ eine liebe einfühlsame Frau die mich auch mal „sieht“ und fragt wie es mir geht mit der ich späßchen machen kann und mich ernst nimmt. Aber wie findet man sojemand? Jeder wird mich auslachen und wie ein versager sehen. Möchte flirten, an die Hand genommen werden und jemand der sagt „aaaw man könnte sich glücklich schätzen dich an seiner seite zu haben“ klingt bestimmt komisch.

theyre sitting in my backpck literally less than a foot away from me and i just feel sort of sick and nervous at the notion of taking them again. its sort of because im a little frustrated at the fact that these tiny little shitpills fix so many of my issues without me even having to do anything, but also because (and i believed this even when i was consistently taking my meds) i KNOW theyre not gonna fix my long term issues. that shit comes from me, not these fucking pills. im also stressed out due to a few deadlines coming up + having procrastinated on said jobs, and now i think im operating under the belief that im not really deserving of such an easy “out” of this state of mind anyway.

1m71cig,How do I get the help I need and stop feeling sad,"I (17M) genuinely just don’t know what to do anymore, and it just feels like there is nothing I can do. I’m currently dealing with heavy amounts of loneliness right now. I’m barely talking to my friends anymore because I haven’t enjoyed talking to them and would rather be by myself. However the point is that I want to be friends with someone who genuinely gets me and that I enjoy and love talking too and it always digs in me knowing that I don’t have this kind of relationship. I spend most of my day online and alone if I’m not going anywhere and when I’m online I always get reminded of how lonely I am and how I don’t have the person I want in my life and I just can’t stand it, especially when at night since that’s when all my feelings hit the hardest (right now is also a time). It’s not even only that I also just have no desire or motivation to do anything, even hobbies. I struggle to even get myself to play a video game which is what I love doing and I just hate it.

If you read all of that, thank you. I’m sorry if I didn’t make sense because it’s hard for me to write about my feelings like this and currently my head is sparking like crazy.

On the other hand, there's another side of me that's trying to hold it all together. One that accepts and laughs at my imperfections, one that denies everything the other side says, one that's truly living life in the moment. This side feels just as genuine. 

It's gotten to the point where I INVOLUNTARILY start cursing/berating myself OUT LOUD, then I have to catch myself and verbally tell myself to shut up.

But then the other side of me shouts over that and asserts that I'm lying to myself about all the self-hatred being unnecessary. But I'm fully aware both sides are lying to each other.

I seriously considered med school the second time around.  Even took the MCAT and did decently. But I backed out halfway through applications. I didn’t know if I could handle the years of training.  I feared that the if it didn't go well, I'd be in debt.

After getting my master’s, I thought about returning to the U.S. I’d moved to Taiwan for cheaper tuition, but didn’t expect how hard it’d be to get hired there.  When I was planning my move a family friend in the States even offered to put me up until I got on my feet. But I stayed.  I was afraid to start over, wanting to be near family.  I simply stayed with what felt safer at the time.

Sometimes I wonder: what if I’d taken the harder road? Worked in the U.S., earned credentials like a PE for a few years, then returned home?

There are other regrets too.  Especially around relationships. Sometimes I didn’t try hard enough, because it wasn't on my list of priorities.  Other times, I chose the wrong ones, or they just didn’t work out.

Back then, life felt more natural, and opportunities to connect were just there — even though I struggled a lot with social anxiety and being shy.

Without other people around like there was in middle in high school to connect with or base ideas off for life with I feel very paralyzed and stuck in seeing my mental health and cognitive health decline and deteriorate, god i can’t believe this is really happening god help me can you hear the pain in my writing 😔😞🙁

I used to get up early to wish people a happy birthday just to make myself something simple to eat, I used to be the friend that would go spend time with friends before noon or before work, I used to be that friend that would make sure my friends were able to afford things even if it meant I was balling on 10 bucks, I used to be the friend that would be consistent with conversation whenever my friends needed me. I have a best friend I had been great friends with up till 7 months ago, I have only two friends but they noticed for the past month I have been acting strange, really not as motivated as I used to. I don't wake up early to wish happy birthdays anymore, I don't have the same friends that I used to because I'm too poor to hang out with them, I don't have any friends to hang out with before noon anymore because they are either sick of me, I stress them out or my misery ruins the dynamic of fun situations. I have two friends now and a boyfriend, my two friends wanted to spend time with me tonight but I was so overwhelmed and depressed that I lied and said I was exhausted. My boyfriend and I aren't looking eye to eye, he thinks that I spend too much time with my friends but would you want to spend time with someone who finds humor in talking about his girlfriend to his mother like I'm the latest form of a shitty person. I don't spend much time with him because I'm depressed, I'm tired, I'm under the weather, I'm living alone while he stays with his friends.

I got along well with the italians and the australian- actually, I did get along well with a fellow from here, but somewhere into out conversation we both agreed that people from our country a bit off, and most our friends come from abroad.

In 4 weeks I'll be going back to that wretched city. Where I am now, you swim where you please, if there's a bridge, there's a view. There? ""no swimming"" signs everywhere- or if swimming is allowed it's only when a life guard is on duty, and the bridges? Huge fucking fences are installed along the railings, which looks terrible- what, are the people there are too retarded to go for a swim or to cross a fucking bridge without someone holding their hand?

I don't want to go back... but, I'm stuck there for three more years. Then I leave this shithole country for good.

Anyway, just heard news about no swimming signs up at one of my swimming spots and just felt a sense of dread at the thought of returning.

Well, I was wondering when I would be happy next, and if it's worth the struggle. I'm not sure it is. I wouldn't mind just... I don't know. dying? I just want to get away from everything.

Whatever. The plan? Go back, do my stuff, probably join a martial arts club, try to be more friendly with people. Try not to burn out. I think I've realized that ample rest doesn't help with not burning out, at least, not alone; I also need a hobby that I really enjoy, and to be around people who make me feel happy. So, yes, find a good way to pass my time, and good people to pass it with... Let's see how that goes.

1m72wp8,A letter to the person who makes me feel small and unworthy,"Dear *namehere*,

This pain has been sitting so deep in me, it’s starting to feel unbearable. I’ve been questioning my worth—not just in this relationship, but as a person. And I hate that. I hate that loving someone has brought me to a place where I’ve honestly caught myself wondering if being here, being alive, is even worth it.

That’s how small and unseen I’ve felt. Like no matter how carefully I speak, it still somehow turns back on me. Like my pain doesn’t matter unless I swallow it perfectly. And when you won’t listen, or when you make me feel stupid or dramatic, it pushes me closer to that edge.

I’m not saying this for guilt—I’m saying it because I need you to understand the weight of what I carry when I don’t feel heard. I’m fighting for myself in this, and some days it feels like I’m barely hanging on. I want to feel loved, not like I’m a burden for having feelings.

You said do yourself, “ sounds like you’re in a toxic relationship with someone who doesn’t reciprocate all the nice things you do for them”.

But you didn’t bother taking accountability, or fixing what could be wrong. You took my words as an attack and threw them back at me.

I lay here, while you sleep, and burn inside from being a fool to think you’d take any accountability at all. While I point my own mistakes, and address how to resolve those, you find nothing that you did needs to be fixed.

You hurt me, and you can care less as long as I continue to shrink myself around you so you can feel superior.

Little did you know, I’m growing to know my worth, anyone would be lucky to have me. But you won’t appreciate my worth until I’m gone.

Unfortunately, unconditional love makes it hard to leave, and I’m stuck in the same emotional abuse that the people I loved before put me through.

Help me, don’t hurt me.

Sincerely,

Me

P.S. The likelihood of you magically changing from my words are understandably zero. Who was I kidding? To think this letter would change your view, when it’ll only be used to hurt me some more.

1m6vo8v,TW: Should I tell my husband about my self harm?,"hi everyone, this is my first time posting (I think). i also wasnt sure which subreddit to post this in bc my self harm is a direct result of my depression but its also still about self harm and depression. 

anyways, as the title says, i’m wondering whether i should tell my husband about my self harm and how things are getting a lot worse for me mentally. i was diagnosed with OCD, Depression, and anxiety a few years ago and am currently on medication and have gone back to therapy. however, things have just gotten worse this summer because i’m extra stressed from my master’s thesis, finding a job, and dealing with issues in my personal life with my parents (my husband doesnt know about the family stuff bc i dont like talking about it). he knows i’m in therapy and about my diagnoses and he has been supportive but i dont think he realizes how bad it can get for me. i married him a few months ago and the last time i cut myself was a month before we met, and before that it was in 2022 or something. i thought i was over it but i should have known better because i’ve been cutting myself since i was 12 (i’m 24 now). recently i’ve been getting the urge to start hurting myself again and its really hard to ignore and to stop myself. i dont know how to describe it but whenever things get really bad its like i lose all self control. ive also not been able to clean our room, wash my hair, or even leave the house (my husband comes over on the weekend because hes working in a different city at the moment and it takes so much energy and mental power for me to clean our room before he arrives so that he doesnt realize how bad things are getting). thats how i know im getting worse because usually i’m really organized and on top of everything. i cant even focus on my master’s thesis right now, even though its in a subject that i love and am so passionate about. 

i’ve tried opening up to my therapist about this but im too afraid to for a number of reasons. also, since i only have half an hour sessions every week we cant go into much depth, but i know that i’m going to struggle with hour long sessions because when i was doing hour long sessions, i dropped out after a month. i’m so tired of trying to pretend everythings fine when i kind of wish i could just die or disappear every single day, and i feel bad for lying to my husband. he has seen one of my larger scars and when questioned, i panicked and told him it was from the airfryer (i had three other airfryer scars on my arm at the time) and he didnt seem to question it bc i always get into stupid situations like that. i’m worried that he might be upset or mad if i tell him the truth about my scars, but i dont want to hide it anymore. i’m also just afraid that this time, things are going to get really bad and will never get better again, or that he might leave me because i have so many problems. i’m scared that hes going to get sick of me and leave. i love him and i’m scared i’m not good enough, and once he sees how bad my mental health has become, he’s going to leave. but on the other hand, i cant keep it inside me anymore because it feels like i’m going to explode or do something really bad to myself.

1m6jiuw,My mom's my only reason to keep going,"I love my mother so so much and I know she loves me as well. I also know I'm a burden but if I killed myself that wouldn't solve the problem, since she'd feel guilty, feel like she failed me.

My dad left not so long ago and she's still devastated. Even before, the relationship ruined her, now she's feeling guilty and bad, just overall conflicted, lost. She trusts me, she tells me about her thoughts and problems. I don't mind it, hoping it helps her but we've gotten closer because of it. A few years ago, when I started having suicidal thoughts we weren't that close, I thought she wouldn't mind my death but now it's gotten so much more difficult. It's a constant spiral in my head, having those thoughts, getting close, remembering her and then this frustrating feeling of not knowing what to do and guilt, knowing I won't do it but the extreme urge to do it and it's crowding my head, I can't think of anything else.

I ( 31 M ) just vented to my wife ( 29 F ) about how I’m feeling with being overwhelmed with everything and how I couldn’t talk with her because I thought she was too tired for me. And how i even felt suicidal because of how intense everything got to me.

It backfired and now my wife is even more upset, she took everything I said to heart and is very distraught with me.  Because I told her that I needed some more affection, Some conversation that isn’t just about the kid or things that I have to do.

At some point do I just accept that my feelings are now on the wayside because the baby is here? Just swallow my feelings and accept that this is it? That’s what my wife if doing apparently but I don’t think I can do it like that…

I have isolated from my friends because I feel inbearable and don’t feel the need to talk until I’m better, but now I have no one to talk to.

It sucks that I can’t talk to me wife anymore, and with all of life going on. I just miss my friend, and I feel like I alienated her. I’m so alone and I don’t want to do this anymore.

1m6t5ry,Daughter Struggling,"Long time listener, first time caller. My daughter (22f) was diagnosed with anxiety back in high school. Over the past 5-6 years we have dealt with it via therapy and medication. For the most part, it has been managed. There were times where the meds seemed to be losing their effectiveness and we switched (doses or drug). She graduated from college and moved to a large city for her dream job and she was a bit homesick but really thrived for the first few months. The time change and the winter weather hit and she really started to struggle. We tried the standard “adjust the meds” and it didn’t work. Spring came and now Summer and, as of Monday, she is taking FMLA leave and has come home (many states away). Her mother and I are worried that she is going to hurt herself and what was once anxiety appears to have turned to full blown depression. I am really struggling with the psychiatry profession right now and could use some guidance from this group. I know everyone’s journey is different but we are at a loss for how to proceed. Admittedly, moving from home to a college town and now to her work city has resulted in multiple changes in therapists, doctors and psychiatrists but we don’t get a consistent answer to questions. She started on Effexor recently and hated the way it made her feel and after a month her psychiatrist switched her to Wellbutrin and she stopped the Effexor cold turkey. Supposedly, she was on the smallest dose so titrating down wasn’t an option. She was really in a bad place during the 2 weeks after stopping Effexor and I’m sure it was withdrawal. But, magically, she went about 5 days where she slept well and stopped spiraling. Then she moved into PMS and it got really bad again. Her psychiatrist upped her Wellbutrin (dose in morning and dose at night) but that has made it even worse (especially in the evenings). We went to a different psychiatrist today because we wanted to learn more about TMS. That psychiatrist said that Wellbutrin was geared towards anxiety and not necessarily depression. But then proceeded to move her dose back down to the original dose and prescribed the extended release. The doctor ordered blood work and we’ll see where that lands but it just seems like we are spinning with multiple doctors. We hope she can move back to her city and job but the TMS means she needs to start and end it in the same place. And we still aren’t sure if insurance will cover it. We are so worried about her and also so frustrated on the uncertainty and inconsistency of the doctors who are treating her. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated.",3,1,1753225719.0,depression,cam-a-licious,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m6t5ry/daughter_struggling/,2025-07-25T09:58:08.751834

1m699g1,My partner wanted to end his life. My parents dislike him. I have no support.,"Hi everyone,
 My partner sat on a bridge overlooking train tracks, last week. He was very intoxicated and whilst I can’t say whether his intentions were to make things final, it’s obvious that he is deeply distressed. He has been depressed his whole life. I am also someone who struggles significantly with their mental health. 
 My partner and I don’t live together. We have a daughter who lives with me and we share family days out. He’s a wonderful person but doesn’t always make great choices. I have been financially supporting him for the past two years as well as upholding mine and my daughter’s life. In turn, this has made me very poorly but I’m trying to keep everyone going. He is very lonely and doesn’t have much of a support system and I am his only person. I love
Him dearly and try my very best to be there and support, unfortunately because I’m having to support everyone, I’m working longer hours and extra jobs so I can’t be there - it’s a catch 22 situation.
 My parents can see how this has affected me and are not fond of him at all. Every conversation about him ends in an argument but I can completely understand their point of view. The toughest part is that now this has all happened, I have no one to talk to. I’m blessed with many wonderful friends, but I don’t like being negative and putting this on them. They are busy people too, they don’t need my negative energy.
 Thankfully, he is getting help and I am so very grateful that he is willing to potentially try talking therapy and start medication.

1m6rgo0,My partner commits self harm. Is there any way I can help her?,"My partner commits self harm. Is there any way I can help her?

I (14M) am in a relationship with a depressed girl (F16). We've been together for almost half a year, here's some context. 

She went through various trauma before I met her, but most notably her father died when she was very young, and I think that started the ""avalanche"". Then, her mother had many problems due to raising her alone while working a job and trying to get rid of her dead husband's debt. This made her feel as if she was a burden, she still feels like that. 

People weren't very friendly towards her in primary school, and she went to many doctor's and therapists/psychologists. They only worsened her condition, because they were unprofessional and/or she didn't want to cooperate. She has back problems, because of a doctor who conducted malpractice, and also worsened her back conditions significantly. 

Afterwards, she went to high school, the best one in town at that. She couldn't keep up, so if she doesn't try and pass a certain subject during the holidays, she will have to repeat the first grade. During that time, she also lost her grandfather. 

These two traumatic events happened to her during our relationship. Now she's depressed and doesn't feel like trying anymore. Her mother thinks she's joking whenever my partner's talking about commiting SH or suicide. She has recently stopped seeing the only therapist that slightly helped her, and she's off of her antidepressants, which only made her more stressed. 

Now she starves herself. She also talks about suicide all the time and today, she committed SH with a dull needle and by scratching herself with a razor and making small cuts. She says she doesn't deserve food, and she just wants to make everything less painful, referring to suicide.

I am the only one that knows about this, and it's horrible. I can't tell her mother, because I don't have her number. I can't call the police/911 because that will put her mother in trouble, and therefore only make my partner turn to these acts more. I can't tell any adult, because they'd call the police. I feel powerless. 

I think it's high time that I mentioned, that we're in a long distance relationship, so me going there and comforting her is unfortunately not possible. 

I offered to try to help her atleast a bit, by, for instance, giving her contacts to people who went through something similar, but she wouldn't let me. I didn't want to force help on her, I know that's not a solution. She also threatened to block me if I said anything wrong, which I also can't let happen, because again, I'm the only one who knows. 

I feel really out of options. It seems as if the only thing I can do is either go all in and do a 50/50 on whether I ruin her life by calling the police or not, or I pretend nothing happened and I talk with her like normal. The only good thing about the second option, is that I think that currently, I'm the only person she can talk to, that won't bring up this subject, and will let her forget about it, even if only for a few hours. 

I am genuinely worried and in shambles, I've already cried so many times, and I am also currently struggling with some problems, so it's very tough for me too. 

The thing is, I genuinely love her so much, I would do anything for her. I know I didn't make that apparent throughout the post, but as of now, she's the single most important person to me. I have always treated her well, giving her sweet treats every time she comes over, giving her her first kiss, watching movies with her, and genuinely spending almost all my free time with her. I never yell at her or am rude, I never force her to do anything either, but it just seems to me as if I am not enough.

All that said, if you took the time to read all this, could you please help me in any way shape or form? Or maybe it would be more suitable to ask - could you please help me help her?

1m6z2hg,Unwanted,"I kinda wanted to just speak into nothing, maybe leave some sort of record of the truth, so I chose here. 

I'm a male in my mid 30s and I've never been wanted. 

I've had essentially three parents - none of whom wanted me. I was never abused and I was taken care of, but out of a sense of societal obligation more than anything else. My biological father never gave a fuck outside of how/if he could use me to get back at my mom. My narcissistic mom only cared in-so-far as I reflected on her and came from her. My step dad, who was in my life since I was 1 years old, stepped up and I know in that sense I'm one of the lucky ones. Of course my mother cheated on him just as she had my bio father and I can't blame him for not wanting anything to do with me by association. 

I wouldn't really say I ever really had friends, more like acquaintances. Temporary companions for a couple years at most. Being myself was pretty clearly a bad idea at a young age so I learned how to be a chameleon of sorts. Throw on a mask and be the filtered version of me people would like and feel comfortable with. 

When it comes to women... Yeah, that's been a trainwreck and a half. I figured out friends with benefits worked best for me but eventually that just started being more depressing than it was worth too. 

I'm a romantic at heart. I want someone I can be completely authentic with and love  unconditionally, but I've only ever loved two women to that degree and - surprise, surprise - neither wanted me back. 

Honestly to say I've never been wanted is slightly untrue. What I mean is that I've never been wanted for myself; for just who I am. 

I've always been smart and capable, and that was recognized almost immediately. I know most people have the experience of being put down, told they'd amount to nothing. I was literally pulled aside in elementary school on multiple occasions and told, ""All those other kids can't actually be anything but YOU actually can!"" Of course followed by some speech to apply myself further and act like I wasn't still 7,8,9 years old...

People have wanted me for my ability to problem solve, to find solutions, to make  things profitable. But never for just me. 

And I honestly learned to live with that.  I thought I was okay with it. I thought I had life figured out and a path I was content with. 

But then I met that 2nd woman I talked about earlier. Sparks flew, we hit it off, thought things were going somewhere... And then she about faced. Gave me the, ""I realized I'm not ready for a relationship"" line. 

It took one glimpse of hope, of a different life where I was actually wanted by someone for just being me to tear my whole world asunder. I knew I was being foolish to even entertain the idea in the first place. It's been 30+ years. I know what the reality is. But I let it crash me anyway. 

And now I can't go back. Im stuck feeling sad and alone - feelings I thought I'd made myself immune to. 

And I know it's not going to get better. The best possible outcome is getting back to a place where I'm just numb. 

Thanks for reading at least, if anyone did.

1m6x7ak,At the end of my rope,"Hello fellow sad people. I’m gonna try to run through my story and where I am now. I’m gonna jump around a bit but that’s kinda how my brain works lol

For my entire life since I was a kid I have questioned everything. At 14 I realized for myself that all religion seems to be a shot in the dark, with all of it likely being somewhat nonsense. How would our primate brains be able to use language that we created to then explain the origins of reality. It simply made no sense to me and still doesn’t. I wouldn’t say I’m an atheist because I don’t know why we are here, but I also know I don’t really have the faculties to grasp whatever created this reality (not sure if that makes sense)

I was very introverted in school all the way through high school. I had a lot of festering self hatred and low self esteem, and always had an intense fear of how others perceived me (this all starting around age 12). This eventually led to a lot of suicidal ideation. I also stopped brushing my teeth and generally just did not care about taking care of myself. I was a smart kid so I had no trouble getting through school despite putting the bare minimum effort into it. My parents I guess just didn’t really notice my lack of hygiene. I had some friends and I enjoyed hanging with them and playing video games and whatnot

Then I went to college. I never had a clue what I wanted to do, and the advice I got from others was typically “you’ll figure it out”. Long story short I spent 5 years at college, switched major 3 times, and ended with a degree in business management. I chose it because it was easy and allowed me to isolate and do nothing but sit on my phone all day unless I had class. Throughout this time I had some good months, some bad, but I always felt I had no idea or plan for the future and I would likely have to end my life sometime after college. Also I did have a girlfriend for the last 3 years of college. She was amazing and she made things fun at times, and I enjoyed making her happy. Also I took care of myself better since I had someone who cared. But I still had no plan for what I was gonna do after college. I broke down 3 months before graduation and told her I wanted to kill myself and she should leave so she doesn’t get hurt. She also wanted kids and I felt I would never be able to take care of kids given the way I am. 

After this I spiraled down to the lowest I’ve ever been. I would eat basically nothing all day, doomscroll, masturbate, smoke weed, and sleep. I would still get my class work done but outside of a few hours a day I sat in my room in the dark doing that. Then I graduated, moved home, and it’s now been three months. The lack of eating has led to me  losing most of my appetite, I am a 22M who is 6 foot 1 and weigh 117 pounds. My job prospects are essentially administrative roles, business (mostly sales which I hate), or entry level roles that don’t require a college degree like restaurants or retail. On top of generally always hating myself, I now face the idea of having to work for the rest of my life and it being things I don’t really like. I have always been super interest in nature, archaeology, and history but now I don’t know how I would ever afford to get a degree in one of those fields.

That’s about all from me. I feel like my only option is to end it but my parents obviously don’t want that. Sometimes I have joy but then I just return to feeling like a failure, also having physical pain from not eating enough and hitting myself in the head (I try not to but recently I did it really hard and my ears keep ringing). My parents say going to an inpatient treatment would be too expensive so basically it seems suicide is my only choice in my head.

 Can anyone help me? What should I do? I have a therapist and psychiatrist but I hate how these pills make me feel and therapy feels like untangling so much shit that it’s not worth it.

Up until a few years ago I’d struggled with intrusive suicidal thoughts for more than a decade.

My situation changed, things got better, did a mental work. Everything was stable and I could start working on ‘the real stuff’ in therapy. 

The past few weeks I’m noticing I’m starting to have these intrusive thoughts again- terrible feeling accompanying them. 

However, I feel disconnected from it. I feel it, I can hear the thoughts, but all of it also feels like I’m observing it as if they are coming from something outside of me. 
There’s almost a disgusting feeling of nostalgia that’s from a different place and time. 
It’s like I’m in a moment in time paused and I can walk around the thought and see them.

1m64hce,A letter to my daughter,"
My Sweet Girl

It’s been a year and a half, and we still miss you with everything we are. It might seem strange to miss someone we only held for three short hours, but I do. I miss you deeper than I’ve ever missed anyone. The kind of missing that aches in the bones and lingers in the quiet moments.

I never imagined this could happen. I didn’t know how real this kind of loss could be, how consuming. This is the first pain in my life that hasn’t faded, but grown heavier with time.

Your mother still cries. That’s the part that shatters me most. She carried you, dreamed of you, loved you with every cell in her body, and she had to say goodbye too. I see the weight she carries, even when she’s trying to be strong. I’d take it all from her if I could. Every ounce of her grief. But I can’t.

And that’s the hardest part. That I never got to feel you kick, never got to share that sacred connection of two hearts in one body. I didn’t get to protect you, or even fully understand what you felt like in this world. But your mom did. And now she lives with that empty space only she can truly feel.

You were our first. Our beginning. I like to think I would’ve been a good dad, at every game, showing you how to change a tire, how to stand tall, how to never rely on anyone who wouldn’t treat you right. I imagined being your hero.

But your mom, your mom would have been the kind of mom songs are written about. I’m so sorry you never got to have her.

This year, we made a decision. Your mom and I promised each other we’d celebrate every holiday, every small joy, every excuse to live fully. Not to forget you, we never could, but to keep from drowning in the sadness. It’s helped, a little. Some days we even make it without tears.

But we both have our time and place.

She cries in the shower at night. I don’t think she knows I hear her. Every time I think about going in to hold her, to tell her it’s okay to break down… but somehow it feels right to let her have that space, to feel what she needs to feel.

I cry in the mornings. Around 4 a.m., when the world is still asleep and I let the dogs out. I sit on the porch, in that old rocking chair, coffee in hand, and I cry until the sun begins to rise. It’s our quiet time, yours and mine.

Today was our anniversary. Your mom and I took the canoe out to the lake and had a picnic, a redo of our first anniversary. Later that night, I imagined what today would’ve looked like with you there. I saw your mom holding you by the fire, your tiny body cradled in her arms while I cast lines off the dock. I let myself believe in that moment.

And for the first time in a long while, your mom seemed truly happy. Laughing. Smiling. Free. And strangely, that made everything feel even more real.

She fell asleep after a little too much wine. I’m sitting out here now, in a camp chair by the water, with a drink stronger than I probably needed. The moonlight is dancing on the lake. It’s quiet. Peaceful.

And I’ve come to a quiet truth: I’ll never stop missing you. That ache will always live inside me. But tonight, for the first time, I feel at peace with what happened. Not because it’s okay, it never will be, but because I know you were loved deeply, even in your short time here.

I hope in the next life, we get to do this right. I hope I get to be your dad in full.

We love you more than words could ever say.

Forever yours,
Dad

1m6esgv,Self-Sabotage Hurts Love,"I’ve learned that not everyone left because I was unlovable. Some left because they got tired of trying to figure out if I even needed love. They waited, hoping I’d let them in, but I kept showing how strong I was like I could handle everything on my own. That strength wasn’t pride. It came from the belief that no one ever truly loved me before. So when real connection came, it felt too good to be true. I asked myself, “Why now? Why didn’t I have this before?”

And sometimes, we unconsciously judge the sincerity of the person in front of us. We test their authenticity, wondering how far they’re willing to go to prove they’re real, but without meaning to, we end up hurting them too.

That’s why I’m learning to stop comparing my experience to others. Every phase of our lives shapes us differently. And if you’ve ever felt unseen or unloved, I’m truly sorry. But promise me, the next time someone shows up with love, don’t self-sabotage. Let them in. Allow them to reveal who they are. Let them show up for you, not because you begged for love, but because you deserve it.

I’m sorry if others once made you feel like you had to perform to earn attention or love. But the truth is, love and validation should never have to be earned.

1m6n9pj,It was a chapter I never closed. I just stopped reading.,"Sometimes I wish I could go back and undo things.  
My 20s weren’t just about growing up (Still in 20s) – they were about surviving. I went through things I never thought I would. Not some epic downfall, but small, sharp, cutting moments that built up over time and wore me down.

In those years, everything I tried seemed to fail. Internships, college stuff, friendships – nothing felt stable.  
But somewhere in all that mess, I fell in love. Not just a crush or passing phase, but something deep, something that felt like home in a world that didn’t make sense.

She was the calm in my storm. The one who saw me at my worst and still stayed. We’d talk about the future, about healing, about making something better out of the mess we were handed.  
But life didn’t let it last. Time, mistakes, and life pulled us apart. And I don’t know if she ever really knew how much she meant to me.

That love – my last love – it changed me. It opened parts of me I didn’t know were there. And when it was gone, it didn’t just break my heart, it shattered something deeper.  
Some days I still feel like I'm living in that shadow.

There was a time I didn’t think I’d make it through. I don’t say that lightly – I was seriously slipping into a place where I thought of ending it all. I kept those thoughts buried, hidden even from myself.  
Then I thought about my brother’s baby, expected in a few days. I wondered, why should I disrupt their happiness by ending my life? I felt helpless, stuck in the center of it all.

But the one constant in all of this was my father.  
Quiet support, unspoken understanding. He didn’t always have the right words, but his presence held me together more than he’ll ever know.  
Even when I felt like the world had forgotten me, he hadn’t.

It’s strange – I never had some big breakdown, no dramatic goodbye. I just stopped. I stopped feeling like myself.  
And that’s the hardest part.  
It wasn’t one moment. It was a slow fading. Like turning the pages of a book and realizing you don’t recognize the story anymore.

This chapter of my life? I never really closed it.  
I just stopped reading.

It's so stupid really, ive been drinking a lot over the past nine, eight-ish months - I'm a week sober today and it's already helping my brainfog a tad, I think.. But I'm also very depressed and have been since childhood, I've never been to the doctor's or sought treatment for this, I'm at the point now where I'm just disconnected from my feelings and everything around me and have been for a few years now, I think it's called disassociation? Even a long time before my drinking, I had memory problems, I'm sure I used to think to myself ""come two days, and I won't remember today."" And I've always been right. I'm struggling to recall what I just ate, I don't remember yesterday, and the only thing I've done in years was go to a concert in December, and immediately walking out of the concert hall, I couldn't visually remember being in there for the show.

Anyway, I'm going to Alton Towers in nine days today... Well, two hours and it'll be eight lmao. This is the very first thing I've felt excited for in...

But my memory issues are really, really getting to me, I don't want to forget this. I don't want the visual recollection of being there gone. I'm afraid I won't remember it well at all the day after, and come a week I'll be really struggling to recall anything. I don't know, I'm really upset over it right now, haha.. well, I don't really feel it, but I know I am at the same time, if that makes sense, underneath whatever is disconnecting me from everything and myself. I know it's so benign compared to everything else on here but fuck, man. A few years over a decade, and this is the first thing that's really put some fucking energy back in me, as childish as it really is, and I won't fucking remember it..",2,1,1753219388.0,depression,Sushi_dragon122,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m6qln6/im_going_to_alton_towers_in_little_over_a_week/,2025-07-25T09:58:08.751834

1m6uq5c,Feeling depressed again after a while (just wrighting whats on my mind),"I have been depressed in the past it was scary but also weirdly nice to just rot in bed, cut myself and wishing to die every day.

 It weirdly became comforting in a way to be fine with just dying, i often tought about cutting my neck open and letting the warm blood run down my body until i was laying in an puddle of my own blood.

I feel like im useless and just pathetic overall, i have no real skills and the one thing im ""good"" at is drawing but im still so shit at it, i cant focus/work on improving at it like i used to and i havent drawn as much as i should so my art skills have just rusted to the point of no return.

Im an adult now and have been for a few months and i even have a cat now, i love him but still i feel the same kinda emptyness that i used to when i was at my lowest point.

I have autism and i kinda feel like im fucked because of it, i feel like i have been given an shit hand at life, i feel like this world around me wasnt made for people like me, i have no friends because i pushed them all away because im an anxiety filled mess.

I wanna make friends but also im kinda horrified of it, i dont want to be alone but my autistic ass wont allow anything else.

Im starting to feel the loss of enjoyment in things again, i dont feel a reason to continue living, i dont wanna live this life because theres nothing waiting for me in the future.

I do miss my friends but also im the reason they are out of my life, i ghost people when i feel overwhelmed.

I havent been sleeping all that well as of late, so that might play apart in me feeling depressed, also i havent and tbh dont want to/i am too scared to go outside.

Im scared of school starting, its gonna be a new place, im not even sure if ill get into the school i want to, im also scared i wont be as good as others think.

I have no future, people still hate me, i have no friends, im an awful toxic person, i have nothing i want or like, and i hate myself.

So why do I have hope, besides my hormones aligning themselves like they should?

I'm losing the momentum I've had the last few days and I'm no longer convinced that I should keep it up. I don't know how to. And am I even worth it? There's nothing that makes it worth it.

1m6lh6t,Back in the hole,"I'm so so sick of everything and everyone. I feel like all the good I had in my life is gone, I can't bring myself to reply to friends, and somehow over the last year a bunch of people have come into my life that I don't really want there, people that have bad energy. I feel really alone and everyone just makes me so mad. So many bad things have happened this year. My dad came off his meds and went insane again, broke up with my mum, she had to move far away from him for her safety, moving in with my auntie who had terminal cancer who has now passed away. My grandparents have left their home as my grandma is in 24 hour care and doesn't eat or speak anymore, my grandpas cancer has returned and spread. I had to go to their house to pick up some stuff and seeing it half empty broke my heart. I can't imagine we'll have them for much longer and seeing the family hub empty was too much.

Someone I was sort of friends with and slept with a few times this year has been arrested for raping and strangling a girl. My flatmate is really pissing me off. My colleagues are really pissing me off. Some of my friends are being overbearing and needy and others are being shitty and distant. There's no in between.

The only person I've ever had in my life who made everything easier and kinder and funnier and more beautiful is gone because I was lost and confused and dumped him 2 years ago. He never got on my nerves. He just got it. No one else does. Everyone else makes me feel so alone because they're so different to me, and I'm so irritable and sad I'm getting riled up over everything. No ones in my corner. 

I still love my dad, the thought of him on his own this christmas breaks my heart. I'm probably going to go travelling so I don't have to choose where to spend christmas. He's not doing well now he's on his own but he's so emotionally abusive to my mum when they're together. I feel for him that he's alone but he put himself there. I'm really really really sick of it all.

  
I haven't been properly depressed for 3 or 4 years now and it's only recently occurred to me that I'm back in it again. I feel like I got away from a toxic home where I was so endlessly depressed for so long, and ended up having a really healing and lovely time in uni and in the 5 or so years after but now things are so terrible again. I feel like I've lost all the gusto I had to improve my life. I don't belong where I am anymore and I can't see a future where I belong again. I can't imagine being better. I can't imagine an end to these problems. It's just more death and goodbyes and sadness and trying to help people that can't be helped. I can't walk away, but I can't do it either. 

I'm so miserable, I just want everyone to leave me alone. I just want to give up. I'm so tired of getting up and going to work. I want to fall into nothingness for a while

1m6oqlq,"If I didn’t have kids, I’d be dead right now.","I’m tired! I’ve been taken advantage of my entire life. My narcissistic mother used me as her emotional support person since a young age. My wants and desires were irrelevant in comparison to hers. Then she married my narcissistic stepfather who took his anger out on me. She never defended me even when she admitted that he was wrong. I’ve never known what it feels like to be loved and protected.

I ended up marrying a narcissist and having 3 kids by him. Our oldest who is an adult now acts like he’s so much better than me. Judging me for the choices I made but my choices inherently made his life easier. My mom stole my inheritance. Out of all the beneficiaries, she took my money because she had access to it. And now that I’m not speaking to her, the whole family has turned against me as if I have no right to be mad at my mother.

Just a couple days ago, my cousin, someone I thought supported me, told me to “get over it” and accused me of killing my mom for breaking her heart, as if my heart doesn’t matter.

It left my abusive marriage. He continued to financially abuse me afterwards, including letting the house we owned to go into foreclosure. I recently decided to pursue my portion of his military retirement, but since I took too long to pursue it even though he’s just retiring, I may not see any of that money. Life is so unfair. He put me and his kids in survival mode while he lived his life freely. I didn’t have time nor the money to even think about getting a lawyer. I’m just now where I can do something about it, 11 years later. Now the lawyer is telling me it might be too late.  

I can’t take anymore disappointment. I wanna crawl under a rock and die. Maybe when my youngest is an adult that’ll be an option but for now I have to keep pushing forward as if everyone I’ve ever been close to hadn’t betrayed me. I hate my life so much right now!

1m6u7qb,Made to feel like a forever inconvenience,"I’m 22, and not a single day in my life have I known rest. Everything in my life has been ever changing and out of my control since the very beginning of my existence. I’ve been through a lot, and as a result, have a lot of things that are different about me. All of these things seem to be something people think I have control over, or that I can just change in an instant. The thing is, nothing in my life has ever really been an active choice. I am not choosing to be one way or not another, I am merely existing as a result of circumstance. I have always been the first to make a personal sacrifice, to change myself for the sake of those around me, to make people more comfortable by dulling myself or making myself unrecognisable. I’ve been through more change in my 22 years than a lot of people can say they have been through in a lifetime. And somehow, it is still never enough. I am still expected to just be okay with changing things that make me who I am or aid me in living/healing just  for the sake of someone else’s feelings. But imagine how I must feel? When I’m told my pain is overwhelming to someone else, that I am making someone else uncomfortable by simply existing, that I can never rest when I’m already so fucking exhausted. No one ever seems to consider that I am tired, too. That the chaos of my life is overwhelming and exhausting for me,too. I feel that no one ever sets aside their feelings for my sake and yet I’ve been doing it all this time. Quite frankly, I am burnt out because of it. My mindset has become one of nihilism, in some ways. And I’m not even allowed that. I just want to do something right. I am such a perfectionist and this is torture, the constant need for me to change. The constant taste of rejection. My mother made me go to therapy for a long time. Mostly because I’m adopted and have a lot of trauma, and the place we live required it of her for the first 5ish years of having me. After that, I just kept acquiring new trauma, so I kept going. I went to therapy for 15 years. I am agonisingly self aware, and also very aware of those around me. I wish I could just shut it off sometimes. Be a little more mindless, a little less observant. It’s so tiring to be constantly processing and dissecting. I am stuck in survival mode and don’t know how to get out. This is all I’ve ever known.

1m6u46o,How do i help friends with mental health while struggling myself?,"i tend to be the friend people go to for emotional support and i gladly always do the best i can to support them and make sure they get through. Ive struggled with mental health issues myself for a long time, and even though im slowly getting a stronger hold of it, i tend to get burnt out and exhausted helping others and take on a lot of their stress, and it makes me feel like a terrible friend honestly.

I know i should look after myself more, because at one point i had a close friend that i put all my time and energy daily into helping, only for them to be a pretty terrible person behind my back, and im still recovering from that.

The last thing i ever wanna do is push friends aside when they need help, but at the same time im barely holding a grip on myself, and the more burnt out i am the worse i am at being a good friend and more likely to be impatient etc

1m6u03f,i find the advice 'life is short you should enjoy it/ not spend such a long time being sad' so hollow,"there i said it, my dads always like this, he thinks me being pessimistic and not believing in myself and being depressed(he doesnt know this part) is a choice, he emphasizes that life is too short, that you should have a winner mindset, that you should always be optimistic and look for opportunity and to never take stress, and to steer away from sad and depressed people because it is contagious (funnily its those people who sctually lifted me from a much darker place)

i dont know if its just my mind but in all the years ive lived ive never really been positive, never had a positive outlook on things, i was always stressed, always thinking the next worst thing, and I feel so powerless, because on one hand i cant really do anything because its not a switch i can just turn off and suddenly im happy, but on the other hand he isnt completely wrong either and honestly i dont know what to feel.

and all this 'advice' or 'thinking' just feels hollow, i know one thing for sure and that is i have depression even if i cant pinpoint why, its not a choice and if it was, i would smack the switch down in a heartbeat.

I live in a town where I don’t have any friends.
And I’m going home to visit, then..
One of my oldest friendships, by all appearances, just fell apart, last night. 
Which is so depressing that I don’t want to interact with any other members of that close knit community due to the grief I’m feeling. Also, I fear  rejection from yet another friend.

Then, I realize that all of my anxieties around interpersonal relationships are the textbook of depression/isolation cycle.

I am naturally introverted and cannot properly decompress with 10+ people living in a double wide modular home.

I really believe my family situation (that I’m not going to go into depth about) is the cause of my depression. don’t have the financial ability to move out. My mom is a narcissist and when I tried to talk to her about this after a couple months of debating whether to even bring it up she immediately turned it around “It’s because you spend most of your time lying down in your room, you’re not actually depressed you’re just lazy and complacent. Why are you putting the blame on me?”  I didn’t say anything even remotely accusatory. I was letting my parents know about my ongoing mental state, which is something I’m supposed to be able to do without being guilt tripped. I’m looking for advice from people who have been in a similar situation. What do I do? As I previously stated, moving out isn’t an option and getting actual medical help is very unlikely.

1m6tvu2,I just need to tell someone,"This is a throwaway as I don’t want people in my life to find this. I just need to vent, so sorry if this is messy. I’m f21

I’m insanely depressed, and nobody in my life knows the extent. The closest was my ex, and I stopped telling him stuff one night while we were still together. I struggle with self harm. I am 289 days clean. He was the only person who knew. The last time I reached out for help, he just joked and said that he loves a crazy girl, and then left me to go hang out with friends. He was awful and was apparently gay the two years we were together, so he wasn’t even into me. We’ve been broken up 4 months ago. He was the only person I had told, and I’m still healing from that deep level of betrayal. 

I literally want to kill myself every day. I seem so put together. I’m doing so well in school. Literally one of the best in my class. I have connections to get a job once I graduate, I’m pretty (not trying to sound self centered), I have loving parents, amazing friends, and financial stability, but I am so so fucking miserable. 

I think about it all the time. Every day is a countdown to one year being clean. I’ve never made it to a year, but I’ve been close before. I’m fighting so hard. So, so fucking hard. I’m so tired. Ive been like this for as long as I can remember. Since I was a kid. 

I was going to tell a good friend of mine the extent of it. I need someone to know. Someone who knows me. Who sees me for everything I am. But we had a situation the other day and I don’t even know if we are friends anymore. 

I found out he had a crush on me, and I’m just not in a place mentally where I can be in a relationship, and it doesn’t help he’s over a 12 hour drive away from me. He needs space, and honestly I’m not even sure how much of our friendship was actual friendship and him just liking me. We’ve been friends since we were kids, so I’m sure we are still friends. But I just don’t know anymore.

I feel like I got stripped of one of my closest friendships, and I’m just so devastated. I’m already hanging on by a thread, and it just felt like I was kicked while I’m already down. I’m so lonely. I have friends. Amazing, understanding friends who love me, but I just can’t tell them. I can’t bring myself to tell anyone. He was the best connection I’ve had in such a long time. I was so close to telling him, and now I’ve lost him because I can’t be the companion he wants with me. I don’t blame him for any of it. If anything, I’m just mad at myself for not noticing sooner and distancing myself so neither of us would’ve had our hearts broken. 

I’m strong. I know I’ll make it. I always do. I always end up on top. But my fucking god it is so hard. I would never kill myself. I will fantasize about it. I’ll shop online for guns and imagine it in my head. I’ll fantasize about self harming. I’ll hold the blade in my hand and stare at it for hours. But I won’t do it. I’m so, so done with it. 

I’ll just keep doing yoga, keep going to therapy, keep working, and just keep trying. All while keeping everyone an arms distance from what is seriously going through my head. 

I’m considering telling my therapist, but I’m so scared. I need someone in my life to really care, but I just don’t know who to tell anymore. I can’t tell my parents, and I don’t want to worry my friends. So I guess I’m just venting here. 

I have a therapy appointment tomorrow at 8:30 pm. I’m working up the courage to tell her.

Secrets hold power, and this is something I wish didn’t have a power over me. This all comes in phases like the moon. Waxes and wanes. I just want to feel at peace. I don’t want to spend every waking moment wishing I was dead. Not just trying for the sake of doing it since I want to die anyway. 

Things just suck now. I know these emotions I’m feeling, all the grief in my soul for the years of heartache I’ve been through, will wane. I’ll be happy again. Not forever, but for a period of time. But goddamnit being in the midst of a waxing is so fucking hard. I’m so tired. 

If you read this far… thank you. And if you somehow know me in real life, I’m so sorry.

1m6tuhn,Idk what to do next,"Hey all,
I’m not sure if this is quite the right place for this, but it does boil down to depression that’s never really went away so I’m posting here for some advice.

I’m 22. spent 3 years studying something just to not be good at it/ like it all that much, and it feels like I’ve just been putting off the future for all that time. And I only did it cuz my mom thought I might like it. Now I have to look for something else to study or find work.

I never bothered thinking about a future, 16 was supposed to be it for me. Alas I’m here, and while my depression has become less pressing and (on most days) manageable, I’m still stuck.

I don’t want anything, I don’t aspire to be anything. No hopes and dreams. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m scared I’m going nowhere. I’m so indifferent about my own life and I feel like ending it is all I can do. 

I don’t know how to care. How to get myself through this. I’m constantly worried that I’ll end up with nothing. I’m not actively suicidal but I sure as hell wouldn’t mind an outside force doing me in.

I thought this because I not trying to unalive myself. I still have those thoughts, but I'm not at risk of harming myself.

Most of it stemmed from my an extremely neglectful household I was raised in that I still have trouble processing but i’ve made so much progress being with my boyfriend and his family everyday and seeing how regular families operate. I’d also say i’m kinda close to his siblings and his parents and extended family are also very kind and have let me stay there when things are rough at my house. 
However, I’ve struggled with self harm and self destructiveness for a while now and find myself and can’t stop trying to hurt myself which in turn hurts him which then makes me feel like crap and I feel the need to hurt myself again. He’s been with me through everything even though i’ve repeatedly told him it’s alright to leave me because of how destructive and unwell I am. I’m not trying to act like a victim in any way, but I can’t let go of wanting to hurt/kill myself even though I can see it hurts him too. 
Recently I stole a bottle of liquor from his parents cabinet and I plan on drinking it knowing that he’s fully against it and he doesn’t want me to drink because it won’t help me solve anything. I don’t know how to explain to him that I fully understand it’ll hurt me further and potentially some of the only healthy relationships I have but I can’t stop and I feel extremely selfish for it but I just can’t let go of wanting to get away or feel hurt

1m6rqaf,Is it normal for healthcare jobs to take this long to start? I feel hopeless,"Hi everyone,

I just need to get this off my chest because it’s been weighing on me heavily. I had an interview for a healthcare job back in May, and I was offered the position. I was so excited and hopeful but now it’s the end of July, and I still haven’t started. Every time I think I’m about to begin, something else goes wrong.

First, it was my DBS check. There was some kind of error, and I had to redo the whole application about two weeks ago. I thought that would be the final hurdle, but now they’re saying there’s an issue with my share code. I created a new one and sent it to them, but I was told they’re still unsure if I can attend the training tomorrow.

This has been incredibly discouraging. I’ve been so patient, but it’s starting to affect my mental health. I’m anxious, constantly overthinking, and honestly I feel hopeless. I keep telling myself to stay strong, but it’s hard. I really need this job.

What makes it worse is that I’ve applied for other jobs in the meantime, hoping something else might come through but I keep getting rejected. It’s starting to feel like maybe no one wants to hire me. I’m trying not to give up, but the constant delays and setbacks are exhausting. I feel worthless and useless, even though I know I’ve done everything I can.

So my question is: Is this normal?
Does it really take this long to start working in healthcare, or is it just the mistakes with my DBS and share code that have made the process drag out?

Any advice, words of support, or shared experiences would mean the world to me right now. Thank you for reading.",1,2,1753222105.0,depression,zimgirly07,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m6rqaf/is_it_normal_for_healthcare_jobs_to_take_this/,2025-07-25T09:58:09.904914

For example: if I laugh too loudly, everyone says I annoy them - but if they do it, I have to stay quiet. If I try to be funny, they tell me to shut up and say I'm not funny. If I don't talk at all, they ask me if I'm okay. I always say yes, because what would they do if I wasn't? I don't even know if they care about me or not.

I'm on the edge of committing suicide, but I (hopefully) won't because of my beliefs. I'm trying to get help, but I fail every time (for example, making a suicide joke as a cry for help- but they just laugh it off). I feel like nobody is going to understand me anytime soon. I feel miserable.

I started vaping three months ago and got addicted AF, but I'm trying to quit now. I threw my last vape away yesterday. I've cut myself a lot, hoping my ""friends"" would ask me about it - but they didn't. Since my mom found out, I've quit.

Do you guys have any tips on how I could behave so that other people give me attention? Because the only attention I've been getting these past months is:
 ""Shut up,""
 ""You're not funny,"" 
""When are you gonna kys?""
 ""I wish I were home instead of being with you right now.""

I always try not to be annoying but Idk what to do everything I do is wrong.

1m6hks6,I want to rest.,"Hello, im obviously making this anonymous, but to make it more personal ill say my nickname, Tom.

  
I'm not really sure how people have such a strong will to live. I see so many people fighting and hear so many stories about people in dire circumstances and they fight to live no matter what the situation. I'm not in one of those dire situations and yet i want to die.

Rest has not come easy for me in many years and the want to die has been a thought for a long time. Well, a couple years ago my depression got to be too much and i actually tried. Im not sure what stopped me exactly, i cant remember. I had it to my head, and when i woke up the next morning it was sitting on my nightstand out of the holster so i know i didnt dream it, but i had full intention to end it and for some reason it didnt happen.

I had a plan a couple of times after that as well but couldn't bring myself to do it because i dont want to hurt my family like i did the first time.  

I dont want to sound like one of those people that complains about all there problems so i dont talk to people about it. What i have said in the past set something off in my family that tore the family apart. I seem to cause problems no matter what I try to do for them. I stay quiet now and mostly agree to everything said to me, i want people to see me as useful and not just as the selfish coward they see me as, even if that really is what i am.

And here goes the list of problems lol....... I dont tell people this because they think i just want attention so ill say something here. I have a diagnosis for Depression, anxiety, ADHD which is fun with depression, a possibility for split personality disorder ( I couldnt afford help for long enough to actually look down that road, but the doctor was pretty sure), as well as cronic illness of some sort that ive had tests done for. I cant eat or i just get sick, or hold a body weight, I cant sleep, I cant focus anymore no matter how hard i try to. I've tried so many pills and none worked. I have bad flat feet that cause pain in my feet and lower back and keeps me from doing too much activity.

  
Its getting bad again, worse this time and i want to to just go away. Im to the point of not caring what happens to my family after im gone. I know thats selfish, but they dont seem to care that im here anyway. Im so tired and i want to rest. i want to feel peace that my adhd wont let my mind have. My whole life is one mistake after another, feeling like shit while doing it. 

Reading this before i post it, and it sounds like im mad or bitter when im not. Im just tired and burnt out.

Ich befinde mich gerade in einer schlimmen Situation und weiß nicht wirklich wie Ich damit umgehen soll. Zur kurzen Erklärung: Ich habe BPD und habe wegen den Symptomen auch öfters auf selbstzerstörerische Weiße Substanzen konsumiert, nun ist es so das ich schon mehrmals versucht habe aufzuhören aber bis jetzt hat es einfach noch nicht gegriffen und klick gemacht.

Nun bin ich aktuell wegen meinen Tiefpunkt wieder in der Klinik, diesmal aber auf der geschlossenen Station.

Ich bin mittlerweile schon 11 Tage freiwillig hier und ich muss sagen dass ich mich den paar Tagen schon sehr zum positiven entwickelt habe, meine Ängste sind großteils weg, ich kann auf normale und ordentliche weiße mit mein Problemen umgehen und sehe wieder Sinn im Leben und will was erreichen.

Da ich aber schon viele Klinik Aufenthalte in diesen und letzten Jahr hatte, erzählten mir die Ärzte das sie sich sorgen machen. Was ich aber als übertrieben empfinde, da ich mich gerade von meiner nicht so netten Familie trenne und eine eigene Wohnung mir hole.

Heute war ein Mann da der meinte ich soll in ein e geschlossene Unterkunft kommen, was in mir sehr viel Unbehagen auslöst, da ich jetzt eigentlich mein Ding machen wollte und selbstständig werden will.

Könnt ihr mir irgendwelche Tipps geben oder wisst ihr was oder habt selbst Erfahrung?

1m68j5s,Sometimes I feel like I made this all up. Or maybe I'm just going crazy,"I'm 15. I live with my family: two sisters, mom, dad. Regular school, a couple of friends, a few people I hang out with. Everything looks normal, but inside, everything has long since collapsed.

When I was 12, I started hanging out with a group of older kids, about 15 or 16 years old. One of them had a younger brother, my age. We became close, hung out, played games.

One day, we were alone, just the two of us, on the rocks. Playing tag or something. He slipped and fell. I got scared and ran away. The next day he came back - no body, no blood, nothing at all. There was nothing on the news either. It was like he never existed.

There was another girl in that group. We were together for a while. She used synthetic drugs. After what happened, I went to talk to her. She had overdosed. I tried to call for help, but she wouldn't let me. I think she died. But no one knows her either. No name, nothing.

Sometimes I think I made them both up. That they never existed.

A year and a half ago, I took too many antidepressants and tried to die from an overdose. Six months ago, I did it again. Both times it was at night. I woke up pale, puking all over my body, and then just went to school like nothing had happened.

I went to see a psychologist recently. He said that maybe these people never existed, and added that I have atypical depression.

Now I wake up at 6 in the morning and just walk around, mostly to smoke. I haven't had a drink in a couple of days. I hardly talk to anyone. I don't try to complain. I just don't know if there's something wrong with me or if someone else felt the same way

What did I do as a child to have the person who would die for me one day start hating my guts, saying she's going to kill me every day, and make me seem like the bad guy for everything?

1m6iyxt,It’s getting bad again,"About two days ago some things happened, nothing serious. I think. But it was overwhelming. I got back into an old game I liked. Looking through fanart and talking to people, I saw a lot of things that made me want to relapse. Even the mention of those things make me feel like it’s a competition. That night I lost all my hunger. I became a bit of a ”gym girl” this past year. But it was so easy for me to throw it all away. I know I should eat, I know it will help me. But I don’t want to cook. Even treating myself with takeout feels like a chore. I haven’t had any pain since stopping eating. I’ve accepted it, it feels natural. The thought of eating feels so.. unimportant right now. When I was in middle school, the peak of my mental illness, I would choose not to eat due to body dysmorphia. I prayed for time like this, to feel nothing. But it’s hindering my goals. I love being perceived this way. Indifferent. I never really recovered. I still think about food like crazy. “Should I eat this?” even during my stupid gym phase. “What’s next on the menu?“  wanting to know what people ate how good it was because I’ll never let myself have the freedom. During my gym phase I realized I wasn’t eating even maintenance calories, I always buy low calorie foods so maybe that was a sign I’m still sick. Its subconscious behavior, I do none of it on purpose and that’s what I hate. I’ll always be the same. Good, then bad and good again. Self harm is one of the urges I can hold back. I don’t have privacy in this house, it’s a hassle to clean up the blood and I‘d prefer not to have this on my adult record if I get admitted into the hospital. Seeing someone else’s pictures make me think, ”That was me. And I want it back.” I guess, the difference of being in a community like that when I was a kid and now an adult is that I’m not as careless. I want to be kind, and it’s hard for people struggling with those things to do so. Because of the “competition“. I want that life back. I want to feel terrible. Self harm is for me. I keep it to myself, no one sees it, it’s the one thing that is MINE. My mind is going crazy.

1m6i3af,Is it possible to love Simeon with depression?,"It’s been two years now, since he and I broke up. Since he told me that my emotions “grate on him” and I decided to end things.

I guess I always get a little sad around this time of year, thinking back to the good times and the ways things ended. Since then I’ve tried to be reflective and accountable. I’m not a perfect person by any stretch and I cried a LOT during that relationship. Sometimes I think I was overly sensitive. Sometimes I think I was crying because of his disrespect or manipulation. Sometimes I think it was a mix of things.

While I don’t miss the one-sidedness or the gaslighting from that relationship, I do miss being in a relationship. The good times, the walks, the talks, the fun. Always punctuated with a sense he wasn’t being totally transparent with me about who he was. And of course, my depression always creeping back in. Times when I told him I was having a bad day and he distanced himself, “to give me space,” when what I really wanted (and asked for) was presence and support if he could offer it. Maybe that was too much to ask him.

And I have to wonder, since he’s the only one I’ve been with, and since he moved on so quickly while I’m still looking, if he isn’t right? I wonder if it’s actually not possible to love someone whose depression runs as deeply as mine does.

I try to take care of myself. I exercise regularly, talk to friends, focus on my art and writing and career. Some days I just crash. But I see other couples who are so vibrant and full of life and then I see myself, so meh all the time. And I wonder if he wasn’t onto something. Maybe it is too much to love someone with depression.

1m6cchs,crashing out over nothing? struggling mentally,"I feel so stupid for feeling annoyed but need to vent so here goes:

My partner has a female friend from his childhood. She invited him to her kid's birthday party. they havent seen each other in perhaps 2 years.

My annoyance is at the fact that at no point am i, his partner, included in this invite. When he told me about it his words were ""aww Amy\* (not her real name) invited me to Sammy's birthday."" he proceeds to respond to the message saying she should send the details and he'd definitely be there. I mention to him he needs to let me know when this is so i can do my hair that day, i was essentialy saying i would need to make my own plans since he's out for the day. This friend knows we're together, she's aware we were expecting (pregnant) a few months ago but had a missed carriage. Im just confused as to why she didnt say ""you and your partner should come"". A friend of mine also had a birthday planned for her kiddo but she explicitly invited both myself and my partner and when i accepted i noted WE would be there. not I.

Am I being foolish for feeling pissy about at this? ive cut out a lot of male friends out of respect for our relationship and his feelings but im not sure how to approach this or if im just making a big deal out of nothing.

We've been living together for more than a year, dating for almost 2yrs. Its not as if she doesnt know that he's in a relationship.

What makes me feel sus about it is that Amy\* and her baby daddy are not married. Im not sure if they are still together as Amy\* is not my friend and we have not met but if the roles were reversed, i would have had an invite extended to both her and her partner.

1m6bqrs,I am sick of life,"So I have been struggling with my studies for a very long time, I haven't got any good marks since 6th grade, Im currently in my last year of school and I failed in Physics and Chemistry unit tests, all my relatives and my parents say that you should study or you'll never become anything in life. But, here's why I can't even if i try.

So my Grandma, being an uneducated yet cunning Indian woman, used to harass my mom when she married my father, who wasn't too rich at the time. She even forced her to work when she had me in her womb, she faced all sorts of harassment and insult, yet somehow convinced my father to move to another city and there he got a job. But my father was obedient to my grandma (a lot) so he was more or less controlled by my grandma only. So what happened was gradually my grandma convinced my dad against my mom, and it has been the same since the last 15 years. My dad and mom are constantly fighting, recently he got transferred to another branch and me, my mom and my sister stay at our primary residence. So I was a good student back then, i got a 90 in almost every exam. But I was also helpless, being a kid seeing my parents fight so badly (sometimes my dad used to get angry and beat my mom), I got trauma. Then what happened was that my grades slowly declined, I don't know why, maybe because I couldn't study, or i lost interest at a point. Ever since that, I have become a loser, I have constantly failed to improve myself and i have been targeted by my relatives multiple times on this topic. My smaller uncle (my father has two brothers, he's the eldest one of them), is a chemistry professor, and he constantly nags me on my grades, and I've come to hate it. Whenever he calls i try to avoid it, but then they tell my dad. My mom also turned abusive after all that happened to her, she constantly shouts at me and used to beat me when i was small. But now I'm 16 so she hesitates a bit. My grandpa also nags me over my grades, same with most of my relatives. I have lost purpose in life, I can't find a reason to study, for my parents? No, for myself? No, For the people that care for me(none)?, No! I don't want success, I don't want money or fame, I just want to be free of all this. Now as I said that i recently failed in Physics and Chemistry, I don't have the courage to tell my parents, I've tried multiple times but when I think about the consequences I feel like dying is the better option.

I have a form of  chronical depression and have been working to be as okay as possible for many years now. But I realised that when I hear a friend is feeling sad/down that I am often overreacting to their situation. 

I guess it goes something like this:   
When I experience being Sad , it will be feeling wise .. let's say a Minus 8

But what others mean when they use the word Sad, they mean Minus 3

And this goes for everything related to emotions: Sad, Anxious, Nervous etc. 

It also goes for happy emotions but these are then turned around: Very Happy for me is just normal happy for them. 

How do I get a better understanding of what ""normal"" emotions are? 

I dont want to overreact.

1m6b60m,How can I support my boyfriend who seems emotionally distant and possibly depressed during LDR?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years, and we recently started doing long-distance because I graduated and moved to a different school. I’ve noticed that every time we’re apart, he becomes deeply sad—sometimes to the point where it feels like he’s falling into depression.

I’m confused and concerned. He once told me that even before we started dating, he often felt gloomy. But now, during our FaceTime calls, he’s very quiet, unresponsive, and sometimes even seems annoyed by my questions. I try asking how I can help, but he always replies with “I don’t know.”

I offered to give him space by not calling or texting as much, thinking it might help—but that only seemed to make him feel even worse.

I feel lost. I love him and want to support him, but I’m not sure what’s the right thing to do. Is this something I can help with, or is it something deeper he needs to address himself?

1m6g519,"I am only alive because of spite, but that's waning","So I (28M) have been going to therapy for the past few weeks. I had to replace my old one because he was not meeting my needs and was just not a good fit for me. I was formally diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Persistent Depressive Disorder. These diagnoses are nothing surprising; I just thought I'd mention on here due to my previous posts on here.
My cousin (27M) is getting married on Saturday. I'm very happy for him, but I feel very unfulfilled in comparison. I have nothing to look forward to, I cannot shake off my weight, I cannot even clean my fucking room without getting sad all of a sudden. I'm a complete mess of a man and I personally don't think I deserve to see another day.

1m6g315,"Diagnosed late with Depression and BPD, and just so tired of the pain and uncertainty.","I just need to put this out there, maybe for people who will understand.
Looking back, I've felt a deep sadness for as long as I can remember. In college, I had friends and a girlfriend who became my everything my companion, almost a parental figure during that time. Even now, long after we broke up, a part of me feels she's the only person I could be completely safe and comfortable with. But the truth is, even when I was in that relationship, I couldn't be fully emotionally available, and I never understood why.
A traumatic breakup finally pushed me to seek professional help. That's when I was diagnosed with long-term Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). It was a lightbulb moment that explained my entire life. I think I never recognized my own depression because of how casually the word is thrown around now. Someone has a bad day and says, ""I'm so depressed,"" so I thought what I had was just intense sadness, not a clinical condition I'd been living with for years.
My therapist recommended I take time off to heal. I was forced to drop out of my post-graduation program just 3-4 months before finishing. I desperately wanted to just stop, take a breath, and take care of myself. But I didn't have that privilege. I had to find a job, which meant moving cities and changing companies. To my friends and family, I just look flaky and uncertain about my life and my decisions.
Now, I've moved to Bangalore, and I'm stuck in a soul crushing cycle of daily interviews and rejections. The worst part is, I know deep down that I'm more than capable of doing these jobs. But the moment I'm in an interview, I can't show it. I'm not able to handle the pressure, and it makes me feel like I'm just not built like other people. The rage of emotions inside is just too much to handle. Honestly, some days I just wish I could hug someone tightly and let all of this baggage out of my chest.
I really want to know what it feels like to be happy. I want to know how it feels to be at peace. I don't know if I'll ever get there. Whenever I try to explain this feeling to people, they tell me my life has only just begun and that I have so much time ahead of me. I know they mean well, but they aren't trying to understand why I'm telling them this. They don't get that the pain is happening right now.
I'm not really looking for advice, just wanted to share this with people who might understand what this feels like.

1m674h9,I don't feel like a real person,"I made a throwaway account to write this, as I do not want too much of my information out there in the world linked to this. I feel like the worst person and like I don't exist at the same time. I just wanted to get it out, even though I know nothing will come from it.

I'm not sure why life is like this, and I know it sounds whiny, but I feel like life isn't made for someone like me. I have been diagnosed with a bunch of physical and mental health disorders (25 in total). None have any cure or any way to make them better. I am constantly chasing symptoms. Some of the worst being BPD, CPTSD, OCD, and ADHD. I can't seem to function, no matter how hard I feel like I am trying. I can't seem to cook regularly, keep anything clean, shower, brush teeth, talk to people, keep anything picked up, etc...

I am going broke trying to force myself to be better enough to act like a real person. Going to doctors, getting medication, doing tests, seeing therapists, psychologists, etc., and none of it is working. Nothing helps.

I can't make or keep friends. Even if I find someone to connect with about one of my issues, they end up having a problem with a different one, which makes them dislike me. I have never had long-term friends. I can't seem to make genuine connections as I struggle with small talk and am usually bad with casual humor.

All my family hates me. Like most of them have said outright that they wouldn't be surprised if I tried to off myself, and that they would be okay with it.

I can't manage to hold a job for longer than a week without extreme pain or a breakdown. I have been constantly turned down for disability, as I am young, and I have never paid into it since I can't keep a job. All I can manage is to do side jobs online for basically change.

I dissociate often and am struggling to feel like this is real life. And if it is, I don't fit in anywhere. All I see online is how much people hate people like me. People hate my race, my mental health issues, my weight, etc... I feel invisible and like everyone hates me at the same time.

1m6ezdo,"my story, still here","I don’t know where to start. Because there’s no moment in my life I can call truly good. No safe memory. No childhood I can really call “a childhood.” There are just flashes—blurred frames that hurt more than they bring any kind of warmth. And whenever I try to go back in time to find something, anything, that might give me strength… I see nothing. Or darkness. Or tears.

In 2020, everything broke. We went to Croatia without my dad—for the first time. We always used to go together. It used to feel warm, funny, like a real family. But this time we brought friends. And he stayed home. From Friday—no contact. Silence. Emptiness. Something in me knew something was wrong.

And then we came back. 3:42 a.m. We couldn’t get inside. Had to wake the neighbor. Got the keys. Walked in.

My dad was gone. Sitting. Surrounded by empty bottles. A lighter under him. Burnt money scattered around. He destroyed everything he had. Just… gone.

The ambulance didn’t even rush. Cops came. Chaos followed. And I saw him again—this time in a black bag.

He disappeared from my life in the most f*cked up, painful way possible. No note. No goodbye. Just silence.

I ran out of the house, sobbing so hard I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. I just kept asking:

Why? Why didn’t he tell anyone? Why didn’t anyone help him?

Why didn’t I help him?

So many questions. Zero answers.

I had to go to his funeral. I remember walking into the chapel. His urn was there. I sobbed like I never had before. So loud, so broken, it felt like my chest would explode.

After that? I remember nothing. My brain blacked out. Too much pain.

No one asked how I felt. Not back then. Not for four years. Only when I went to a school therapist because of panic around training, he asked about my dad. First time anyone had the courage to bring him up. But by then, it was already too late.

After he was gone, everyone at home broke in their own way. No hugs. No shared pain. Just silence.

People worried about my mom. Sure. “She’s the widow,” “she’s raising kids alone.” But me? The girl with a storm in her chest? Forgotten.

First year of high school, I made friends. Girls I laughed with. Trusted. I thought it was safe.

Then things turned. Suddenly I was “too much.” Too sad. Too intense. Too talkative.

They made fun of me. My sweating (caused by meds), my clothes, my energy, even my dogs. As if I chose any of that.

I told my mom. She talked to their parents. It calmed for a bit. But then it came back.

My teacher said: “Just talk it out.” That’s it.

And training? It used to mean something. But then came fear. Panic. Shaking. Crying. I couldn’t breathe.

First panic attack: June 2024.

It only got worse. In January, I quit completely. I just couldn’t anymore.

And loneliness? It eats me alive. There are moments I just need someone to talk to. But there’s no one.

So I sleep. It’s the only time I feel peace. No school. No people. No past.

And the scariest thing? I don’t have strength left. Not for school. Not for therapy. Not for pretending.

Self-harm? Yeah. It happened.
Not out of curiosity. Out of desperation. To feel something else. At first it was empty. Then came short relief. Then guilt. Shame.

Thoughts of ending things? Yes, twice. Not for attention. Not as a “cry for help.” Just because I didn’t know what else to do.

Once at school, after a fight with my mom. I had meds. I used them.
It didn’t work. Again.
And I felt even more broken. Like I can’t even fail the right way.

I told a friend. Asked her not to tell anyone. She said she “couldn’t handle losing me.”
Well… I think now she wouldn’t care.

Therapy? It feels fake. I sit. I listen. I nod. Nothing changes. I feel like a number.

Individual education? Small relief. At least I don’t have to fake being okay around people who clearly hate me.

The voice in my head tells me to give up. Or smoke and shut the f*ck up.

It says I’m useless. That I forget everything. That I mess everything up.

That there’s no hope.

Because this thing called life?

F*ck it.

And I’m not saying this for pity.

I’m not some overdramatic teen posting sad edits.

I just feel… empty. Dead inside. Like I don’t exist anymore.

I look in the mirror and see a ghost.

I see the scars. I don’t feel shame.

I see a story. A scream. A fight. That no one heard.

And yeah… I’m still here.
I don’t know why.
I don’t know how long.
But I am.

If I could say one thing to the world, it would be this:

F*ck life.

1m67eqt,Unknown understandings,"
This year, I wanted to be more talkative than last year, but now I feel like I've talked too much. I should have been quieter and not trusted anyone, even those who seem trustworthy. Being human is tough because people just enter your life, and I don't even want them there. I've been through so much so quickly why me? Maybe it's a lesson to being a better person. I feel misunderstood maybe my mom is right, and I make others miserable because of how I act.

I wish I could erase my mistakes, but I'm also grateful that God saved me through institutions. They made me realize that a past relationship was based on lust, and since I didn't want that, I ended it. But the boy acted so strangely about it, and I just wanted him to leave me alone. I went back to him, hoping he would stop hating me after everything he put me through, but he didn't even explain himself. I gave him a chance, but he was still weird, so I moved on, and then he got upset at me.
I understand now that I hurt his feelings and probably made him feel a certain way, but revenge isn't the answer. He now disgusts me as a person, and I've publicly embarrassed myself because of him. I never did anything wrong I just wanted to move on and be happy again. I haven't been happy in a long time, and the things we did together were fun until I realized the reality of it. As of right now, I'm probably going to be happy sooner, in the name of Jesus, but right now, I definitely have emotions, and it drives me crazy.Maybe the people you meet aren't always meant for you. As much as I've matured in different areas, I've definitely reached a new level of maturity. There are many things I want to move on from because I'm better than the people who hate or envy me, and I need to keep my head up high. But I also wonder why I did certain things. I honestly think I did them because I fantasized about them and wanted them to happen, but I forgot the consequences or how it would make the other person feel. Sometimes caring about how others feel makes sense. I didn't care about how he felt, so he made it known that he didn't care about how I felt either. But also, never blame yourself for someone else's mistakes. Remember, you're here for a reason, and what makes you who you are shouldn't be changed because of someone else's preferences.I just want to push myself to be a good person. Doing drugs might make you feel better temporarily, but you'll never forget your problems, so what's the point? I'm just hurting myself. But maybe I do want to die. I've been unhappy for so long; what does living do for me? I beat myself up every day for a mistake I made months ago. I'm never going to move on, and I'm never going to stop thinking about it, and it's nobody's fault but mine, so who can I really blame?
I wonder, for my future self, am I ever going to be happy? Am I ever going to forget this? Will I still be cute? Do people still think I'm weak? Am I going to surround myself with better people? Will I ever forgive myself?",2,0,1753168256.0,depression,One-Conversation4049,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m67eqt/unknown_understandings/,2025-07-25T09:58:09.905918

1m66ylc,I'm feeling like I'm human trash.,"So basically I am in a state where I am extremely vulnerable to affection from others and a couple of weeks ago this person I most likely can't have charmed me into making it impossible to not yearn for more of their affection. I can't stop thinking about them and it hurts so much. I have a long history of rejection too so honestly I just feel like a garbage unlovable sack of shit. I don't want to leave my bed. I don't want to go to work. I don't want to do anything, but bask in the affection of this person when it isn't possible. I'm so fucking tired of this. I'm the type of person that requires plenty of affection and human touch to function properly and I can go vast swaths of time without anything at all. A lot of times it feels like I'm a ghost to others. I also suffer from chronic fatigue/hypersomnia which only severely multiplies and exacerbates all of this. I can't take it anymore.

I honestly truly and deeply don't want to die. I KNOW I want to live and laugh and love and smile and I guess go to amusement/waterparks and shit, but the conditions of this hellhole in which I reside and the meat suit I inhibit are highly incompatible with that dream and the further I proceed into the future the louder I hear the beckoning scream of the noose.

I've been told all this time that I just need to hang on and eventually life will get better and  become worth living. But my question is, when? All my life things have only consistently gotten worse and worse. I've been alone ever since moving out. I don't have family. I have one solid friend group and they're probably the only thing keeping me alive, but over the last couple years I don't even get enjoyment from spending time with them anymore. It's just the same shit day in, day out, every day of every week of every month of ever year for the next 50 years until I die. Go to work, come home, sit around drowning myself in my vices, then go to bed and repeat the same thing the following day. If this is all there is going to be til I die, and considering the state of the world it's incredibly likely to only get worse, then I don't want any part of it. I'm constantly angry, I'm constantly sad, I constantly hate myself. I even started going to therapy and got on SSRIs. I still don't feel any better, or like I'm any closer to feeling like any of this is worth it. The only thing I even really want in life is to find someone to love but I'm so incredibly mentally ill that I can't be in a relationship because I'd likely only hurt them, either with my mental issues or my anger issues.

1m65zhr,Depression as Chronic Stress: My Perspective,"**Disclaimer:** *I'm not a healthcare professional; I'm just someone living with depression trying to understand it. This text may contain errors. My only goal is to share my view of depression based on my experience.*

Depression is often seen as a huge, complicated problem — but maybe it doesn't need to be so hard to understand.

# The Real Cause Behind “Multifactorial”

People often say depression has many different causes or factors. For many, including me, that’s confusing: where do you even start if there are so many? But from my experience living with depression, I believe it doesn’t really have many fundamental causes. There’s one main factor: **stress**. The “many causes” of depression actually come from the different **stressors** that trigger stress in each person. Stress itself, however, is universal — we all feel it — and it can be understood and managed.

# Stressor vs. Stress: What’s the Difference?

A **stressor** is what causes your stress — and these can be many things: illness, negative thoughts, bad diet, loneliness, unhealthy habits, genetics, sensitivity to stress, and especially **trauma**. Traumatic experiences — especially early in life — can leave deep marks that make the body stay in a constant state of alert for way too long. **Stress**, on the other hand, is your body’s natural reaction to threats. It’s useful and important in its original role. The key is that while you might not always fix the stressor, you can lower your **stress response** with solid, consistent habits.

# Chronic Stress and Its Effects on the Brain

When stress lasts too long, it literally changes your brain physically. Studies show these changes (see:[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29421159/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29421159/)) and the brain changes seen in depression ([https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8490908/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8490908/)). Interestingly, these changes affect the same brain areas, showing a direct link between chronic stress and depression.

# From Stress to Depression: The Breakdown Process

Stress wears you down — mentally and physically. But depression feels like what happens when that wear and tear becomes chronic, like your system has been running on empty for too long. Both stress and depression involve similar damage: fatigue, negative thinking, poor sleep, low motivation. But depression feels like the next level — like your mind has stopped trying to recover and has shifted into survival mode.

In that sense, depression could be seen as chronic stress taken too far. It's not just a response to a threat anymore — it's the aftermath of prolonged overload.

# Self-Destructive Thoughts: A Twisted Survival Mechanism

Self-destructive thoughts don’t happen for no reason. Our body hates stress because it drains energy and resources. Long ago, when we faced real external threats (like predators), stress responses made sense — a quick, harsh reaction to survive.

But what if the “threat” is inside? When stress comes from fearful or unrealistic thoughts about your own reality? Your brain’s response might be self-destruction. It might sound strange, but your brain treats internal threats like external ones because it can’t tell the difference.

# Care and Treatment: Tackling the Root

Taking medication alone isn’t enough if you’re sensitive to stress. That’s why having a balanced routine is essential:

* **For Stress (universal management):**
   * **Regular exercise:** helps regulate your nervous system and release tension.
   * **Nutritious diet:** avoid sugar, unhealthy fats, and processed foods that increase inflammation and biological stress.
   * **Stay hydrated:** drink plenty of water.
   * **Sunlight exposure:** helps regulate your body clock and mood.
   * **Sleep hygiene:** get good, restful sleep to recover body and mind.
   * **Social interaction:** getting out and connecting with people is vital.

These steps help reduce how sensitive you are to stress by working directly on your body.

* **For Stressors (individual management):** This depends on your personal problems: physical illnesses, negative thinking patterns, unhealthy lifestyle, toxic relationships, and more. Therapy can help with many stressors. Some problems need medical help. Whatever the case, always seek professional physical and mental healthcare.

# Conclusion: Depression as Advanced Chronic Stress

I don’t think there’s anything “new” here, just connections I’ve made that might help others like me who suffer. Depression isn’t a “disease” in the usual sense, but it can deeply damage you. More than that, it’s an advanced stage of chronic stress that, if left untreated, can cost your life.",2,0,1753162906.0,depression,SaladPrevious4722,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m65zhr/depression_as_chronic_stress_my_perspective/,2025-07-25T09:58:09.905918

1m61pa7,I don’t know what to do about my drug using son. I think he might be depressed.,"I don’t know what to do, but I’m scared for my son. He’s 22, graduated college last year, and has been living in our guest bedroom ever since. He says he’s “working remote,” but all I ever see is him sitting in the dark typing on his computer.

He says it’s “data engineering.” But he won’t let me look at what’s on his screen. He bought a computer and I don’t have his password. It’s just flashing numbers and colored blocks. I asked him what his job is, he said “latency-optimized ingestion.” What does that even mean?

He barely comes out during the day. He says he’s “on the grind.” But then at night he disappears. He takes his laptop and says that goes to “coffee shops” in the city to be around people. He only leaves after dark! I told him how there are drug addicts and criminals out there and going out alone he will get mugged or worse! I read there was a stabbing outside one of those places. And sometimes he comes back with weird energy. Like twitchy. Or euphoric. Or like he’s seen things.

And now the pills. Bags and bags of them. All from Amazon. Things with names like “NAC,” “L Theanine”. He says they’re to help him focus. But that’s what the kids on TikTok say before they end up seizing on the floor. I looked one up and it’s literally a dopamine drug. Nowadays everything is being laced with fentanyl but he won’t listen! The bottles say “nutricost” which I googled and it seems like it could be part of a cartel. He says he takes the pills everyday, it’s only a matter of time.

He mentioned something about an order book and crypto do I think he is selling on the internet too or at least using the internet to buy his drugs.

And he’s gotten so cold. He doesn’t talk anymore unless I bring him food or ask how his “programming” is going.

I’ve tried everything. I make his meals, I wash his aheets, I even unplugged his router once but he just used mobile data. I don’t know what else to do. I think I’m going to have to call the police if this keeps up. Or at least the wellness check team.

Is anyone else dealing with something like this? I feel like I’m losing him to this and I don’t know what to do. He was going to get a career with the internet doing websites but instead it’s just this nonsense.

1m680wo,I don't remember what its like to cry,"Please read I need help. Backstory: I used to cry a lot over small things when I was young, as most people do, but one day I decided to toughen up and teach myself not to cry. It took a few months, but eventually I didn't cry over pain anymore. Looking back, this was probably because my pain tolerance went up as I got older, but in my eyes that was the first step. Then I started to try harder and not cry over emotional things like sadness, stress, etc. I'm now 16 (just turned) and haven't cried for about 4, 4.5 years now, with the exception of the end of attack on titan (which was rly hard to do but I managed), and some other time recently (I don't remember anything about it just that I cried).

The problem is that I don't remember what it is like to cry. I already forgot from those previously mentioned 2 times, and I kind of got lucky those 2 times, idk how I did it, so I can't do it again. I think I trained myself to block out any thoughts about crying to the point that I block out memories of crying.

Regardless of the reason, I need to cry. If you know you know, but it feels like I'm completely empty and have an imploding pressure, the kind you get right before you cry, but it just gets worse and worse because I cant release it.

I’m 17 with no life had to drop out of college and haven’t been out with my friends since October. I’ve done the therapy and I got told to journal every time I’m sad but it practically became a suicide note of 6 pages while I sobbed. I’m a burden on everyone in my family and cause I’m so dependent I’m ruining their life’s aswell so maybe it would be better if I just gave up because everyone else has. I’ve tried so hard went to doctors went to camhs and a therapist and none helped because the doctors can’t give me medication but has no other options to help .

Sometimes I wish they read the journal to see how I really feel because the know I’m a bit sad but not to the extent I’m at because I love my family but I can’t have them put the lives on hold maybe they’d be sad at first but they could move on and live a burden free life

1m67utx,Suicidal,"I have been automatically coping with depression for many years. I feel I am a very resilient person. If I felt like I hadn’t accomplished enough or started feeling overwhelmed by failure I would look back through my Instagram where I’ve posted all my wins and the cool things I got to do in life. 
If I was feeling sad I would watch comedy. The 
 office is my favorite. When I was unemployed to feel accomplished and useful
I would work on my art and set goals for myself with my art. I even turned it into a side business so I could still work when unemployed. 
I would travel or get out of my town if I felt stuck. I really prioritized travel financially because I knew it helped me feel better mentally. And when I feel lost or directionless I set new goals for myself and commit to them. Like going to grad school or taking the LSAT. 
my point is I’ve done a lot of coping sometimes subconsciously and my family has attacked it all. Sometimes I don’t understand why it bothers me so much when they say it’s annoying I rewatch the office so much. Or they keep me from doing my art or they interrupt my goals. Like a little comment or small interruption is usually isntt bothersome to me but then i realized these things are literally how I’m hanging onto sanity and they are attacking them. It makes it doubly bad because they are also the main cause of my situational depression. Being stuck around them always causes me to become severely depressed and suicidal bc they are toxic and then they go after my coping mechanisms on top of it. It’s like they are pushing me to commit suicide. 
I’ve been trying to permanently get away from them and cut ties my entire life. I left home at 16 hoping to never return. But I have ended up coming back bc of losing my job, having financial instability, etc. so many times. I can’t seem to stay away. And it’s not a problem of being attracted to the familiar/known. I’m very good with new experiences and have made every attempt to stay whenever I’ve been out on my own. It’s just financially been impossible with losing jobs etc. Now it’s 10 years later and I still have no way out. I am ready to commit suicide. I can’t stay with them they are too toxic so I’m living in my car for now. But I really just want to end it. And all they said when I told them I’m staying in my car and not coming back to their house due to the toxicity was affecting my mental health to the point of being suicidal was that I should come home and I said I can’t. And they said ok and went to bed. 
Not that I expect them to do anything for me. They are too toxic for that. But again it really seems like they are pushing me to commit suicide. They’ve made several comments that they don’t believe I will do it and I’m just saying it to threaten or be manipulative. 
Ironically it’s not them pushing me to do it that bothers me so much. I expect that from them.  It’s the reminder that I literally have no one who cares if I live or die. I’m completely alone so what’s the point of staying alive?

1m67jtt,Advice on starting therapy with SSRI and struggles,"Hi everyone, I'm 24 (M) I was struggle with my anxiety and psycho-somatic symptoms since December.

I've always been a full-life person but the world around me feels empty and I tried to do a lot of things without the possibilities to do so.
I've tried for years to known more people, study etc. but even If you're empathic, smart and good looking it's not enough today.

Think of me of a great mind blocked by high wall, and I'm siffering from it without knowing and live stimulating people and situations.

Everything start as a period of high stress and IBS, then I excluded organic problem with a lot of visits before I went to a psychiatrist (expert in psycho-somatic disorder etc.)

Initially he suggested me to try the Mutabon Mite (Amitriptyline 5mg + perphenazine 2mg) to stop the IBS and get a soft relaxing behavior.
It causes me to vomit/have diarrhea and I was also about to faint for the exhausting day (this on late February).
I even tried Laroxyl for few days (only Amitriptyline) but still causes me a lot of dizziness, nausea and more.

**Since then I struggle to eat more (and I lost ~10kg.. a defeat for one who eats a lot and workout before) and I've always careful and vigilant about medicine and foods.**

He then proposed me to try **Escitalopram, starting from 2mg to 10mg in 2 weeks and try the effect.**
It also said to try Levopraid to stop the side-effect in the starting weeks.

After few weeks (starting from late March/April) I decided to go to a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist that is against medication.
But I wanted to get the combo suggested medicine therapy + psychological.

I wait months to start it since I feel better but then the terrible experience again:
I've tried the **Levopraid (10 drops as suggested)** and it caused me more nausea and a strange sick-behavior. It's strange that an anti-nausea and anti-emetic causes the opposite and still doesn't work? So I quit the therapy in a days.

The symptoms got worse recently and I went to another psychiatrist again, who prescribed me the exact same therapy of **Escitalopram (Cipralex for us in EU, more known as Lexapro in US) + Levopraid (levosulpiride)** for 1 months.
I asked him why since I got worse with Levopraid and it says to try even more for 3 times a days (30 drops in total).

Now I'm blocked since no medic help me to go against my thoughs and phobias, but just stick with the therapy even if it got me worse (?)

They say that my problems are easily to be solved since I was good before and then they escalated quickly for simple reason.

What's your suggestion and how could I get better? Thanks :)",1,1,1753168792.0,depression,PsychologicalEcho454,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m67jtt/advice_on_starting_therapy_with_ssri_and_struggles/,2025-07-25T09:58:10.877806

I feel nobody will take me serious if I don’t kill myself and even then I don’t feel people might , I’ve been crying for help for so long and nobody helps or sticks around to help. 

Im tired of being told call a mental crisis line or text  it’s pointless because can’t talk to professionals freely or they will send me somewhere if I say I want to die . I don’t want them to send me away I don’t want to be made out to be punished for my feelings I need someone to listen and hear it without automatically reporting it don’t wanna I’m terrified of it and I don’t want it so I have to lie and then i don’t get enough help and if i do say I’m suicidal they just ask if I’m actively suicidal if I say yes they will take me away or report it etc if I say I’m
Not I get dismissed like I’m not a priority and don’t get adequate help it support. 

im tired of being told that life becomes easier and that I need to do this or that to be better yet no help , im tired of always being told im not doing enough. Or be painted as I’m not trying . 
I feel I can’t do anything I feel
Incapable of doing anything I live in filth is don’t leave the house I don’t eat or sleep I feel disgusting and not like a person anymore I feel I have lost myself completely . 


I just don’t wanna do it. 
I’m
Not going to kill myself right now but I just don’t see what the point is of trying with no purpose no people in my life and nothing to look forward too not even to wake up and be able to look after myself. 

How do I get help how do I find a way out of it by not killing myself how do I do it please I live on the Uk 
I just don’t wanna live like this anymore 

I have sat for an hour reading people’s stories about how they are suicidal and it just reminds me how I know I want to live and I know I want to not give up only reason I’m still here but how is it fair that because my strong will is so strong that I’m just considered a strong person that “ isn’t suicidal enough” to get actual help telling me to read q leaflet or have a call it’s not helping me how am I supposed to get out of it how I feel lik nobody cares that even the professionals that your supposed to get the help from

1m5zhtr,Waiting for the apocalypse,"I see people delving so deeply into things they love and wonder if there's something wrong with me for not doing the same.

I fear that I may be anesthetized to life forever, no matter what progress I may make or what relationships I may build. I fear not being emotionally present when it matters.

As my understanding grows, my world is illuminated by the same monochrome light, instead of the many colors I used to fill that darkness. My extrospection has hollowed me out, as I failed to cultivate my spirit in fear of experiencing the frailty of my existence.

Everybody looks so pristine and embodied; watching others exist so seamlessly feels like having their fingers pointed at me, ready to cast stones at me for my inhumanity. It fills me with burning hatred for their existence; it makes me wish that the whole world would be plunged into the same crushing uncertainty that has made my life mine; I want their perfect faces to be slashed to the bone so I can see that their blood is the same shade of red as mine. I want their existence to be made meaningless by the absence of the structures they so seamlessly stood on, leaving me to grovel at their feet.

I'd be thankful- the moment you settle, the moment life stops moving, you (an ordinary man) die. Without promises or potential, life grows stale, and you fade; love in its purest form dies.

I cannot trust myself to experience joy vicariously through the lives of my children or whoever I'd deem to succeed me and what I've chosen to represent; I'd despise my grimey, wrinkly, death-smelling, decrepit body and dying mind. I've always been filled with the most primal form of disgust towards the common, family-having senile, and their ways of life.

To die an untimely death is a tragedy, yes. But there is nothing more honorable than dying with your mind set on something higher.

Their desire, set by the stakes, would make their souls shine brighter than they ever would’ve within their ordinary lives. It would make their pathetic, disposable existence worth everything- even if only for a fleeting moment.

My whole life, I’ve been praying for the day this world would be consumed by despair. I’ve waited for the day when eternity would come forward. I’ve longed for the day when everything is now; the time when all is to be lost or gained.

Talk of wellness, of family, of career paths, life plans, vacation, and retirement makes me sick to the bone. I’m sick of this suffocating world where not a single thing changes and nothing is to be expected beyond the fulfillment of the most basic biological needs.

Life isn't something to be preserved- life is something to be burnt, spent. It is better to experience a flash of divinity and then be extinguished than to rot in sentiment.

May this world be damned for my place in it.

I (f20) am not afraid of death, and constantly hope natural selection will take its part in my life. 
Lately my depressive episode have progressed more and more deeply. Every time I get tired of trying, my plan gets more and more detailed, my list of reasons get longer and longer and going ahead with taking my life becomes more tempting. 
Only thing is, I am in a healthy relationship, I have a precious cat and have family who have watched loved ones take their lives before. I obviously don’t want to affect them. 
But the reason for suicide just make sense? Why on earth would i be hopeful for a good long life if I can’t even afford food? A necessity TO live? I don’t have the right quarks for practically any jobs that won’t deteriorate my healthy in few years. I’ve already been strong since I was practically born and I think fighting for this long is enough, the mental endurance and being stuck on bread and water for my whole life makes me believe that I was born into what I will live, why hold on to that type of life you know??? 
Anyways, not sure what I want from letting this out rather than just letting this out. I don’t seek comfort just maybe “I understand and won’t blame you” from people rather than the whole “things will get better” shenanigans.

1m657nz,Hello need help/advice,"Hello everyone I’ve come on here to vent and gather up some thoughts on what my emotions mean

Im about to be in my sophomore year of engineering school come soon and I can’t help but feeling insanely depressed all the time. I don’t know why really. Everything is going the way it’s supposed to. I’ve made friends to live with, my gpa is high, I’m even starting to get active in my local music scene and making friends there, I have a job etc. I just don’t know why but I feel bored and uninterested in everything I do, I cant connect with anyone. The best way to describe is that literally everyday feels like a chore. The only days I enjoy are when I have nothing to do and I go to the gym and play guitar. But even then I get frustrated in my own isolation but I know if I try to socialize I’m just going to get frustrated and go back to isolation. 

I’m also very concerned about the future. I don’t want to grow old and I don’t want to spend my youth working hard but I know I have to for engineering. I feel like money doesn’t even matter and that I could just go do whatever I want to do and actually live my life. But then I also want to work extremely hard in school and make a lot of money. But then again money doesn’t even fucking matter. It’s also not like I’m in engineering for the money I love coding and robotics. 

I also find my self really lonely sometimes as well. I’ve struggled my whole life with self confidence hating how I’ve looked for my entire existence. I also have pretty bad social anxiety as well. I’ve never had a girlfriend or a love interest in my life. Not even trying to be an incel either I’ve had girls interested in me but my lack of ability to communicate sometimes hinders the energy.

I have attempted to take my life once, in September, and had intentions to do so another time in June 2024. My mind feels like its mush most day, any remotely intense task feels impossible to work out. Everything stresses me out, sorting, fine details in anything, work, school, future, but especially my father. 

I have grown go resent him, his yelling and screaming at the most trivial things, every-time he’s in a bad mood he will make it his number one goal to make it known. I hate that about him, I used to be the same, but I’ve grown to realize that it’s a really shitty thing to do to make other people’s day shitty just because your’s is. We work and live together and I started driving in separately just so I can start the morning without having to listen to him yell at the traffic for 20 minutes after we leave 10 minutes late because he has no regard for other people’s time.

I honestly don’t know where to go from here, I’ve been through so many ups and downs in my mental health, but the future looks bleak. In the past year I’ve attempted on my life once, lost my job, major car troubles, almost failed a semester, withdrew from my final semester, had another breakdown, and now I’m here. 

I’ve started to try to pick up any random hobby just to try to feel better, but nothing is sticking. The only thing that made me feel better was being away from this place when I met my online buddies in person for the first time when we all went to Washington for our friend’s baby shower, that was the first time I’ve felt normal in YEARS.

1m5uwc8,"college stress, dropping out, no motivation","I have been drowning under my depression for years. I've been a college student since 2020 and I hate it. I been on and off medicated for a couple years and got off of since it did nothing for me and I ended up in a mental facility. I am about 2 years from earning a degree in biology (that's if I can manage to finish before dropping out) and I hate it. I have no motivation to study, fully aware of how bad my gpa (2.16) has become and my grades are subpar, but I continue to do nothing to change it. I start to study and I begin to cry and get so overwhelmed that I have to take a break within 15 minutes. I hate doing anything that does not revolve around reading (that is my main coping mechanism) and it has become such a crutch and I cannot image doing anything else.

I have considered dropping out of college a couple of times and I have brought it up to my family but my thoughts have been dismissed, saying ""it's just stressful right now"" and ""you're so close to finishing"". For the past 3 years, I have had a breakdown about college. It is usually mid semester and wreaks my already fragile study habits for about a month.

I am so lost and annoyed and tired, I just want to read. But the idea of dropping out is terrifying, it has been so long and such a waste of money to no get that pesky diploma. All of my trauma and endurance would be for nothing if I simply call it quits. I am afraid that dropping out would make me feel extremely heavy, and I already feel so weighed down.

I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow but I needed to get some thoughts out of my head before I implode.

1m601pi,How to manage depression while keeping myself accountable?,"I'm a 22-year-old whose friends are currently graduating while I still barely have any credits. I switched to a major I truly loved, but despite this, still struggle and have crashouts. The issue isn't the course load, atp. I've taken fewer classes and usually the struggle is that I start the semester strong, keep going, halfway or 3/4 of the way through I struggle with something, I start slipping but insist I can fix it on my own, then spiral, I spend time reigning in my emotions, by the end of the semester it's too late for anything. I'm so sick of this constant spiral. My parents have helped me pay for debt in the past and I at least want to live long enough to pay them off, and I do want to get better, but it's such a struggle trying to find a therapist/psychiatrist. 

My family states that I'm bad at holding myself accountable. I know I am to blame for not reaching out sooner, whenever stress creeps in, I shut down and withdraw, and it's a bad habit. The issue is that I don't know how to stop. It's so draining trying to reach out for help, getting emails, being forced to wait ages, thinking about my brain on its own makes the color drain out of me.

I'm pretty good at hiding my struggles, though. Most days I'm in my room regardless and my parents don't even know about me failing my last two semesters.

1m5weki,"Deepest, Darkest Depression","I've suffered from major depressive disorder and anhedonia for three decades. The MDD has been mostly kept at bay the past few years – other than smaller episodes here and there. Currently I'm experiencing one the harshest and longest episodes I've had in well over five years. I cry daily. The past few days were spent in bed crying and sleeping. The emptiness is unbearable. I'm at my end. I can't reconcile all of my past mistakes, all my regrets. I don't see any path forward. 

I ruminate constantly on the what ifs from my past. How my life today be different had a made better choices. I cannot stop replaying alternate versions of the reality of my past, imagining my other life today had I made different decisions. 

I ruined my marriage because of dysthymia which exhibited mostly as irritability and ultimately avoidance. I just shut down. My wife wasn't very good at communicating. So instead she had an affair with a former friend. Then she left me. I was in my mid-40s. I'm now nearly 60. I still think about her these many years later. We were both introverts. Both quirky and creatively minded, both atheists, and I thought we would grow old together. It made me happy to think about us growing old together. Now she's remarried living not too far from me.

1m5m2py,No purpose in living,"I(15M), found no purpose in living, I even feel that it's foolish to live in this cruel reality. I don't understand why everyone wants to continue living, To exist in this reality, we have to fight and compete against each other over and over again. Like, what's the meaning of it? 

I know that the reason they can continue to live is because of their purposes, their goals, their ambitions, their loved ones, etc. But I don't have any. And people around me are expecting me to be successful, while I don't have any purpose. I always think of the words ""I hate everything, I want to die."" every single hour in consciousness. 

It sucks. I don't even ask anyone if I want to live, and yet I'm here carrying their expectations. I don't want to be stronger or special than anyone, I just want peace. And it's impossible to achieve it in this shitty reality, because of how it works. 

To have good things, there needs to be bad things, and to have winners, there needs to be losers. It's fine if it will end someday. But hell nah, it continues over and over again, and we just continue hurting and devouring each other again endlessly. 

I had a purpose to live before. I once had love, but we already broke up. She was my everything. I got all fired up and motivated because of her. The days in relationship with her were priceless. I don't think someone as pessimistic as me would get loved by the one who can light up my fire anymore. 

For me, if God exists, I don't think he ever loves us. If so, why create the reality that everyone has to get hurt, and repeats it over and over again? That's it, I don't care anymore. I'll just let my existence be whatever it would be.

I was hoping you guys could give me some insights into knowing what to do with free time. I was recently prescribed Rexulti and Im feeling like im in overdrive! I don't know what to do with myself! I've been in depression for so long I think I forgot what I could do with my time. I could some of my hobbies, but sometimes it's not enough to calm me down. So far this is what I have available: 

1. Videogames

2. anime

3. Manga, and other things to read

4. watching streaming media

5. gunpla

6. lego

7. Finally, the things I didn't use to do which are exercising, cooking, other productive things. I still find myself reticent to engage in these. I've also been thinking for so long about studying stocks and other stuff but never have enough motivation to do so.

1m5xayz,Below the water line: short story about what depression episodes feel like from someone who doesn’t know how to explain feelings cause autism,"I’m really bad at describing how depression feels and that weird thing of sort of wanting to be in it when you’re there? Life the comfort of it. Coming out of a week in bed today and tried to write something that explains what it’s like, I never post anything I write but was curios for feedback and I’m bored. I’m not a writer I just write shit in my notes page for fun sometime. Enjoy:
I havnt been to the ponds since the autumn, when the water was colder and the covered in leaves, the air was cooler, and things still made sense.  Now, the air is thick and sticky. without my glasses I can’t make out the water in the dark. The only indication that I’m standing on the edge of the pond is the sound of my friend body splashing through the water and the damp wood under my feet. I shut my eyes and curl my toes against the edge of the platform, rocking back gently onto the heels of my feet every so often and clenching my hands to make sure my bodies still beneath me. I open my eyes and try and squint to make out the surface of the pond to no avail. 

I try to imagine what I must look like to teenagers drinking and smoking by the diving board at the other end of the platform. This strange woman in her underwear, clenching her fists and toes, rocking back and forth, squinting at the water. Eventually, I accept that I will have to jump in to the black nothing infront of me. One final squint, and I close my eyes once more and push off, arching my body, hands outstretched in what feels like a very clumsy dive. 

Then I hit the water, first my hands. Then arms, face, before I know it the cool water wraps around my ribs and stomach and thighs, and then I’m fully under. The music and laughs of the teenagers goes silent, the pain behind my eyes and in the back of my head numbs, my body feels like it’s dissolving. I keep my body straight, forcing myself down further into the water, the pressure building in my head and trying to force my body back to the surface. I breath more and more air out of my lungs through my nose, tensing my stomach, allowing my body to grow heavier, sinking deeper and deeper. At the bottom of the pond, as far as I can get, I wave my arms in circular motions to try and fight the buoyancy. My lungs start to burn and my legs and arms ache, the pressure in my ears throbs. Still I perist, forcing my body not to rise out of the quite cold. 

I stop moving, allowing  my body rise back up, slowly, up to the surface. When my head breaks above the water, everything is so much louder than before. The wind scratches against my skin, I wipe the water out of my eyes and glance around, I can only make out a flared light from someone’s phone back at the platform, filling up my field of view, stabbing into my eyes. Their voices sound off key, all shouting over each other, layered into an unintelligible matted wall of sound. After a while of treading water, my legs go limp, I take a gulp of air, shut my eyes. And let myself drop back, below the water line.",2,2,1753137424.0,depression,Local_Feed4737,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1m5xayz/below_the_water_line_short_story_about_what/,2025-07-25T09:58:10.877806

1e297nd,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",20,27,1720873558.0,mentalhealth,DrivesInCircles,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1e297nd/rmentalhealth_is_looking_for_moderators/,2025-07-25T09:58:12.000342

(ii)  provide assistance to State and local governments, through technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the identification, adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and “step-down” treatment standards that allow for the appropriate commitment and treatment of individuals with mental illness who pose a danger to others or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves.”

1m8afqa,Husband Involuntarily Admitted to Mental Hospital,"I'm not sure what I'm even doing posting this but I'm so overwhelmed and alone. My husband was admitted to a mental hospital against his will after having an extremely manic episode that involved shaking/stuttering/suicidal thoughts. When it was happening, I obviously felt extremely sad, but I was somewhat hopeful that he would get the help he needs (he has been struggling for a long time). 

I went to visit him yesterday and it was so horrible. I didn't expect the place to be lavish or anything, but seeing him there in scrubs looking miserable has broken something in me. He only talked about how angry he is to be there and how he should have hidden his symptoms better so he wouldn't have been admitted. He doesn't want me to tell his parents/siblings where he is or what's happening.

We have two young kids I'm trying to care for on top of working, and I truly don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. If I take them both out of daycare, I might be able to afford our mortgage and our most basic bills (electricity, gas, etc.), but that's it. And then I will have them home with me while working a full time job. 

I am trying to balance my empathy for his illness with my family's situation, but it's so so hard. I guess I'm just yelling into the void. If anyone has any experience with something like this, it'd be great not to feel so alone.

1m8rj3m,Is it too late for me,"Hello, 14M. I made a post asking if anyone else eats only one meal a day. I explained in the post that recently I haven't been eating when I'm hungry, unless I'm so hungry it hurts or it's dinner time, so sometimes I eat two things a day. Dinner is usually small stuff like burgers or chicken or pasta. 
People commented on that post saying that I might have an eating disorder. They also mentioned it could stunt my growth and mess with my brain. I would like to mention that I haven't been diagnosed with anything except anxiety, which I take medication for. Last year I might've had an eating disorder because I used to not eat until my parents forced me to, to which I would get upset when I had to eat. I would count my calories and I used to eat around 900 calories a day. 
I don't count calories anymore, but based on the amount I'm eating now I'm guessing the amount of calories I eat daily is still around that. I don't mean for it to be. I just can't eat unless I absolutely have to.
Is it too late for me? I know I haven't been diagnosed but if I do have an eating disorder I don't want to go to the hospital. My family is in the process of moving and I don't want to burden them with anything like that right now. I know it can mess with my brain or worse, but I really don't know how to just. Eat.

1m8scbb,Want to support my girlfriend,"
Hi everyone I hope this is the right place for this. My girlfriend has lived with Major Depressive Disorder and a splash of bipolar since she was younger and I’m trying to learn how to be a better partner for her.  I want to be clear, I’m not tryna  “fix” her or be the superman here. I just want to support her better, especially with mood swings or low moments, even some self harm but she’s been really strong. Right now we cope by spending time together like watching cartoons until we fall asleep but I can always sense something brewing underneath the surface. She doesn’t like talking about her own emotions and can be prone to spirals so I’ve adjusted my focus on just being a steady partner rather than pushing her to talk. I know MDD isn’t something that goes away by talking about it but I’d love to hear firsthand from others who have experienced MDD, depression and all of its facets.

1m8s1n2,Not super important but i would like some advice?/Venting,"Hello! I hope I am making this post correctly (sorry if this goes against the guidelines I promised I read them ;-;.)

I don't want to vent too hard and I'll try to keep things short-ish (sorry). I kind of depend on people in the sense that I hate being alone. When I mean alone I mean, it's hard for me to see everyone I know having fun while I sit out uninvited. I think I forced myself to believe that I'm the last pick, because usually I'm not invited to things. I try to bring people together for gatherings/events. But when it comes to things not planned by me, I'm usually not (or at least it doesn't feel like it) invited. I'm always the one who has to reach out first, even after explaining how reaching out first feels.

I guess I feel like I'm struggling with my self worth, as I notice a lot of the time I worry if I'm important enough to warrant people wanting me around. I've been in this situation my whole life, never keeping friends for long. I've always yearned for a connection like that but I know I should never rush it. It just seems like people don't like/want me around, and I get really upset when things don't go my way (I used to lash out but it was swiftly changed).

This leads to my question for advice? I'm not sure what to do about this, as I've tried talking to them but every time they say it's ok. When I get upset, it's really hard to feel better. I've gotten so many tips but it just doesn't get better no matter how hard I try. It's like logically I know that I shouldn't be sad about this, but in my heart it just feels like it's being squeezed until it pops. I feel like I tend to overreact . I don't know if I know my emotions are valid. It's just hard to know if I'm trying to manipulate people into feeling sad for me. I feel like an attention seeker talking about this and whenever I want to talk to someone it just hurts a lot. and I don't know why.

1m8roti,feeling like my life has an 8yr timer.,"(i have a long history of childhood abuse so that might play into this.)

i love my horse, we've been through everything together. we spend all day training, exploring, just finding a spot and hanging out, or playing together. before him, i had a passive death wish and he turned my life around in every way possible. we both have separation anxiety in different ways. he'll be completely calm in a place that makes him a little nervous, but if i walk away he panics and starts rearing. if i'm away from him for a week, my mental health tanks. 

he has another 8yrs of being a working horse on him, and i've kind of accepted that when he dies, i'll probably go with him. it doesn't even feel like it's up to me, it feels like even if i wanted to live longer, my body and mind would just fail without him. 

he's the only thing that truly calms me down, understands me and if i'm being honest with myself, the only living creature i really trust. he's always been there for me and just recently saved me from a drunk man. 

i'm not super worried about it, but it's starting to creep up on me. i hate to admit it but i'm more worried about him dying than myself going with him.

1m8ri9h,I think I am turning into an addict.,"I won’t go into the details of my life, but know that I have had an extremely rough one. However, recently I’ve been noticing, and so has my family, that I’ve gotten addicted to Tylenol PM. Yes, I know, how embarrassing, but I think it’s the acetaminophen and diphenhydramine in it that I am becoming addicted to. I can barely sleep without it, and every time I take it I feel like a wave of release has exited my body. 

I know down the line I will probably be addicted to other types of drugs that produce dopamine, most likely alcohol too. Part of me wants to stop, to not go down that path, the other part of me wants it to happen. Ever since I was a kid I’ve been in internal conflict with my heart and mind, I don’t know what I want. It’s affected by relationships, my academics, my work, everything. I am lost, I always say that I don’t live life, I just exist, passing through time and space while (mostly) everyone around me is living. If anyone suffering with this problem (or has suffered) sees this, can you give me any advice? 

Edit: I guess I should mention I’ve had the same situation with other medication; lexapro, any type of pain reliever a psychologist has given me, stuff like that.

1m8r7c8,I don’t feel fulfilled by music production anymore.,"Here’s the story, like many others I had the drive to create music like my favorite artists did. I was inspired by them so naturally I studied their production and what made it so good by recreating my favorite beats at the time (I originally played conventional instruments before turning to music production like guitar/bass/drums so I saw replaying other artists songs was the way of learning). After improving and learning sampling techniques I began attempting to put together a sort of instrumental album? I don’t even know what it was supposed to be looking back at it and it went nowhere. Then I tried the Metro Boomin approach where I would get together various artists, give them my beats, and arrange the songs into a project. In the middle of doing this I scrapped the idea because I noticed I really wanted to start writing my own music and become a fully fledged artist, rapping and producing everything, this would fall flat but become a big part later. Anyways I had tried and failed a couple times trying to make an album/project as a producer/rapper so I focused on just being a producer. I made a YouTube channel which acted as a sort of storefront for my beats, I stuck with this for about a year and a half. I had a pretty big following, I made some sales, and I had multiple beats with over 10k views, but the artist in me wasn’t happy. As my consistency waned, so did my audience, and I abandoned the channel. I didn’t get into selling beats for the money, my only goal was to see great artists make great records with my beats, I saw it as a way of fostering collaboration and connections. In the end I wasn’t happy with what they were doing with my music, didn’t matter to me if I was making money if the music was trash. So I pivoted back to what I originally wanted to do now that I had the skills, I started making an album and becoming a fully fledged artist. As of me writing this I have 6 albums released under two artist names, the first three were released under my first artist name and they’re incredibly embarrassing hence why I left it behind. I’m very proud of my new work and I love every project I make, but this creates new issues. I’m falling out of love with my new work, it’s something most artists experience but it is really messing up my life. The magic of making beats has been lost because I’ve now developed a mindset that every beat I make needs to be turned into a song, that’s how I’ve been operating for over two years now and it worked. Now I don’t feel fulfilled by production alone but I also don’t like making full songs anymore. Maybe it’s just a phase but it’s so excruciating, creating art is what I live for and it was the only thing that made me feel good, but now no matter how good of a beat I make it will never feel fulfilling until I make a song out of it and put it on an album. 

I just want this to feel fun again like it used to, I want it to feel fulfilling, I want it to feel worth something.",2,0,1753422382.0,mentalhealth,Dummou,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8r7c8/i_dont_feel_fulfilled_by_music_production_anymore/,2025-07-25T09:58:12.000342
1m8qyqg,Is this normal,"Idk abt wrong flare but sorry if it is 

When I was really young, around 5, I had frequent panic attacks about eternity, heaven and it going on and on and all that (raised a Christian) and I still haven’t grown out of it. The idea simply of it completely terrifies me, and that alone I legitimately need fixed or honestly I don’t think I can go on living like that, I have panic attacks almost every night when I’m trying to sleep, it’s horrible.

And, about a year ago, it was around Christmas time when my parents and family got sick. Now usually I was fine with it, took some immune boosters or medicine, and went on with my life, but that year it was a lot different, I was absolutely terrified of the idea of getting sick, I would panic, check my temperature every 5 minutes, and if it went up at ALL I would nearly break down crying. (Example— 98.7–98.8. Literally panicked from that) and that hasn’t gone away either, it’s actually gotten worse, to the point where I’m scared to touch people if they’ve coughed. I genuinely hate it so much. Anything health related nearly sends me into a panic attack just at the mention of it.

Every time I’m around something like my phone, I’m literally scared of radiation or getting a brain tumor from it (yes, trust me I know it’s stupid) and then I could be fine the next day but it always come back in horrible waves. Idk if I can say this here but sometimes if it gets too bad I thought about going to the kitchen or somewhere and grabbing smth (idk if I can say it here but yk) I’ve never done it but I have with my nails a lot but I’ve never ac used something bc I’m kind of scared to but I feel like I’m so immature for crying, and Ik people have much worse problems and I think these are so insignificant but please if anyone has any suggestions, or if this is normal or not normal please tell me because idk if I can be fixed",2,8,1753421535.0,mentalhealth,Lynnlovess,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8qyqg/is_this_normal/,2025-07-25T09:58:12.000342

I am not insane and my views on the world, life, and reality as well as my desire to not exist are all based in rational and logical reasoning. It simply doesn't seem worth it to me to live life truly as I have pretty much just been existing and escaping from what life truly is. I don't want to work and do shit I hate for the most of my life until I die, especially since it is ultimately meaningless.

I currently am and have never been employed and I dropped out of college after not even 2 years because I didn't really give a shit about it, I heavily disliked it, and it just would've been a waste of time and money as nothing would come from it because I truly didn't want anything to come from it.

This is a known fact about me and I’m pretty unique but it’s honeslty draining. I’ve finished my exams and been off for summer for a while. I should be happy but all I think about is stupid shit. And want to be alone all the time.

I keep adding up these problems that aren’t a big deal. I’m so lonely and think about relationships all the time. People tell me to give it time but I really need a guide to keep my mind off it. I always have anxiety out in public but that’s pretty regular for me. That’s why I like alcohol. But everything just feels like an oncoming life problem. I feel if my life’s worse I’ll become a full blown alcoholic. Plus I struggle with drinking.

I have a great family but just keep pushing them away and I don’t know why. Everyone in the house annoys me at the minute. And I don’t have a reason why just feel like an outcast.

1m8hl7w,METHOD that accidentally fixed my energy problems,"So I've been feeling like crap for months, just constantly drained and couldn't figure out why. Thought maybe I was just getting old lol.

My friend suggested tracking how I feel each day so I started writing simply down my energy 1-10 and what I did. Felt stupid at first but whatever.

After doing it for a while I noticed some stuff. Like I always felt terrible on Sundays even though they're supposed to be relaxing? And days when I stayed up scrolling til like 2am were always rough the next day (shocking I know).

Weirdest thing was that my energy had nothing to do with how busy my day was. Some of my most exhausting days were when I had literally nothing planned and just scrolled my phone all day.

This whole thing got me thinking more about myself in general. Like I started paying attention to patterns I never noticed before and became way more aware of how different things actually affect me. Stuff I thought didn't matter at all was actually draining the hell out of me

I also started noticing my emotions more like okay I'm feeling anxious right now... why? Why am I feeling this specifically now? Sounds dumb but I literally never did this before. I'd just feel stressed or whatever and never really question it.

Turns out even basic stuff like actually drinking enough water consistently made a huge difference in how I felt. Always been terrible at sticking with stuff, no.. but srsly... lowkey think I might be ADHD. Tracking helped me see that consistency actually works, you just gotta wait longer than your brain wants to  
 I use something like [MoodBaze](https://moodbaze.com/home) or  [Google Fit](https://www.google.com/fit) to track it. Nothing fancy. But now when I feel like garbage I can usually figure out why instead of just being confused.

1m8p74u,How do I find my purpose in life?,"I am struggling to find purpose in my life. I’m not suicidal or depressed I’m lost. Maybe I am depressed and don’t even know it. Right now I work a good job, I’m living with my parents, and paying off student loans. I have a good amount of friends within my circle. I got out of a relationship about 6 months ago. That was a mess. 

Back on topic, I have ambitions and goals but I feel like it’s so hard to stay focused. I was able to lock in for about a month or two but it seems like I always fall short somewhere and it leads me back to the beginning. I feel like when I try things out by myself I never see results. Even in the gym. I workout about 3-4 days a week. 

I struggle with self discipline, I get 5-6 hours of sleep a day, I do stick to a diet but even then it’s hard to stay on it during the weekends especially around friends and family.  

I need advice from guys who are single, what do you do to stay focused and locked in? Do I need counseling? I need answers and I need to find my drive and purpose in life. I know this was somewhat inconsistent, thanks for taking your time to read this I’ll be reading everyone’s response.

1m8szpg,steps to getting better?,"It took me a while to realize this but I feel like I might be going through something that’s starting to affect my personal life. I’ve always been someone who likes to keep my room clean but it feels so messy now. Getting up is extremely difficult. I lose hope for any future/ constantly feel like the future is grim. Being productive at work is hard. I have little to no sex drive. I feel like I’ve been forcing myself to feel happiness when doing things with people even when I’m not, so I don’t feel bad for not being happy. I think about how not being here anymore wouldn’t be so bad. I get irritated and angry easily. Eating feels like a chore. But then there’s days when I just binge eat. Probably good to note that about 4 months ago I started taking edibles again because of how stressful work was and I was having such a hard time sleeping then. I stopped for 2 weeks while on a vacation and I actually felt slightly okay then. To be honest I secretly cried a few times during that trip but I won’t go into details on that. Edibles helped me just forget and knock out. I’ve been taking it quite consistently but decided to stop about a week ago. I plan to not get back on it for the next couple of months at least. I do think that these thoughts have been around even while taking the edis, just acknowledging it all now.

What are some initial steps I can take to avoid being this way? I know how lucky and loved I am but I also can’t help feeling this way and I feel bad feeling this way because it probably affects the people around me especially my partner and my family.

1m8g8cu,I’m being bullied in university and I feel completely alone. I don’t know how to keep going.,"Hi everyone. I’m a 19-year-old student and I’m going through something very difficult.

I stopped talking to a toxic group of classmates, but we still study in the same group. After I distanced myself, I started talking to other people, but the toxic ones began laughing at me in front of the class.

I’m scared to defend myself. I feel frozen and afraid.
Teachers and the administration don’t care. Other students also started to ignore me, and some of them became closer to the people who are bullying me.

The toxic group keeps gossiping, throwing passive-aggressive comments at me, laughing, and staring at me constantly. I feel like I’m being watched and judged all the time.

I still have 2 years left before I graduate, and it’s exhausting to keep going like this. The bullying is slowly destroying me inside.

I don’t know how to make it stop. I don’t have friends, I feel completely isolated, and I sometimes feel like I can’t take it anymore.

If anyone has been in a similar situation — how did you survive it? How can I mentally protect myself when no one else is standing up for me?

Thank you for reading this.

1m8swoe,Please help,"Hello, I'm a 19-year-old male, and this is the first time I’m truly opening up. I don’t like the direction my life is going. I was raised in a strict Christian Slavic household, and my childhood was filled with trauma. My father had anger issues and took them out on us through violence towards me and screaming towards my mom, I understand that he had a very difficult life himself, it left me with a harmful example of what it meant to be a man. 
Because of that, I never really developed in a healthy way. I turned into someone I’m ashamed of. I am a liar, a manipulator, even a thief. I lied about my past, saying things like a friend died, or that I was a drug user or dealer not to look good, but because I didn’t know how to face the truth. I still lie about who I am today, and I feel stuck. If I tell the truth, people might think badly of me. But at the same time, I don’t want to care what people think  even though, deep down, I clearly do.
My biggest struggle isn’t just lying it’s that I feel incapable of doing anything with my life. I can’t keep a job. When I moved out of my parents’ home, I started using drugs. I’m easily influenced and drifted into self-destructive habits. Now I’m back with my mother, and I compare myself to everyone who seems to be doing better than me. I have no confidence left. On the outside, I might look intimidating, but inside, I’m emotional and broken.
I genuinely hate myself. That hate has taken over everything. I’ve lost the ability to love people, I use them for my own gain, even when I know it’s wrong. I think about how bad my actions are while I’m doing them. I want to stop. I want to change. I want to love myself, to follow my dreams and not give up after a few days. I want to stop chasing quick dopamine. I want to quit smoking cigarettes. I want to stop being cruel to my mother she’s the only one who ever truly tried to help me.
But because of my dad’s influence, I built up a kind of hatred for showing love to my mom. I want to break that. I don’t want to yell at her anymore. I want to listen. I want to be a good son. I want to become a good person again someone who’s passionate, motivated, and optimistic, like I used to be. Bad influences and fake friends have only made things worse. My parents are heartbroken because of me, and that only deepens my self-hate.
Please don’t hate my dad. I know he caused damage, but I’m not writing this to blame him. I know the problem now is me. I’m open-minded, I overthink constantly, and I suspect I may have ADHD though I haven’t been diagnosed. I’m not trying to excuse anything I just want to be honest.
I hate who I’ve become. I don’t want to compare myself to others anymore. I don’t want to use people. I want to change. I want to live with purpose and finally chase my dreams without quitting. I want to feel proud of the person I am. But right now, I can’t do it on my own.

A while ago, I was juggling too many things — mental pressure, money worries, relationship confusion — and trying to keep a straight face through it all. I kept thinking “it’ll get better soon.” Spoiler: it didn’t.

Then I stumbled across a mindset mentorship that someone from our team was organizing. It wasn’t therapy or a lecture — it was like getting tools for my brain. I didn’t even know how much junk I was carrying mentally until I learned how to clear it out.

No drama, no miracle. Just clarity. Like for the first time I could *see* my own thoughts and fears without being stuck in them.

1m8ol8z,do therapists only take you seriously when you’re falling apart?,"i recently had an intake with a new therapist/med provider, and i walked away feeling completely invalidated. i’ve been previously diagnosed with adhd, bpd, and ptsd. these aren’t new concerns they’ve been a consistent part of my life and treatment history. but during the intake, they said they “didn’t feel comfortable” diagnosing any of those at this time. instead, they focused only on bipolar 1 and anxiety.

here’s the thing: when i was on adhd medication, i was actually functioning. i kept my space clean, i could focus at work, i did my schoolwork, and i had a sense of motivation. now that i’m off meds, all of that is gone. i’ve been masking like hell to stay afloat, but that doesn’t mean i’m not suffering.

i also haven’t had a manic episode since stopping medication no psychosis, no delusions so i’m even questioning if bipolar 1 should be the main focus here. i relate way more to bpd symptoms: intense emotional reactivity, unstable relationships, fear of abandonment, identity issues, etc. and yet, that got completely dismissed.

it’s just exhausting. i’m trying to advocate for myself and be honest about what i’m experiencing, but it feels like because i’m not totally falling apart in front of them, i’m not being taken seriously.

anyone else dealt with this? do you really have to be visibly spiraling to get proper care?

1m8sabr,"Lost the ability to relax, and now it causes panic","When I was in my teen years, I practiced Buddhism all throughout middle school and high School. I would wake up at 5:00 a.m. and meditate and slip deep into the cosmos.

Fast forward to 2020, and for the first time my breath was against me, I had never felt so Breathless and unable to take an inhale for longer than a quarter of a second, it was so bad to the point where I was intubated for 3 weeks, i al,oat died. I was 24 years old.

Ever since then, simply taking a deep breath is enough to send me into panic and make me have to get up and walk around.

I used to do this thing back in high school where I would stand under the cold shower with the water running over my head and down my face while taking deep breaths and doing affirmations, well I try to revisit that  in 2023 and sent myself into a full-blown panic attack for the first time. 

Now it's so bad to the point where I can't even breathe during lifting, or yoga. Being in a car that feels like it doesn't have a lot of space also sends me into a panic. If it's too hot I begin to panic

My insurance for some odd reason doesn't want to approve me anxiety or a panic disorder medication even after evaluation, I can't help but feel like I'm red flagged by my insurance for no reason. 


This is so bad to the point where I had a fairly mild confrontation with another man, and as soon as my heart rate went up and my breathing got a little weird as it does in confrontations, I immediately went into a panic attack... this is literally ruining my life.

1m8nv3l,Im sick of feeling like this,"Hi 19f here. I guess this is just kind of a rant to get it off my chest. 

I’ve been struggling with depressive feelings for as long as I can remember. They’re on and off always but since I was maybe 17 I have been experiencing these bigger episodes where I literally just break down and can’t function for a few days. The first one I remember it starting at school and I just hid in my car and sobbed for the whole day and next few days until it faded. Since then I have probably had 4-5 more episodes like this, theyve come sporadically throughout the past 2 years. I just spend the whole day crying and can’t eat and when I do things it’s like auto pilot. This is also accompanied with suicidal thoughts and just kinda apathy and a whole lot of self hatred. Eventually these episodes fade and I go back to being normal with only my normal amount of depressive feelings. Some times I have no depressive feelings though and I can go weeks without them.

But this episode is particularly bad and it’s making me realize that these feelings never really have gone away, I’m just good at managing and blocking them out. 

I get out of bed and can’t do anything, I just stand there overwhelmed by all these things that are really so minuscule and non-issues but feel mountainous at the same time so I just get back into bed. This spirals into the self hatred—I just kinda hate myself and I want it to be over but I’m justifying it by telling myself these feelings will fade in a few days like they always do. But I’m scared because the last two days I’ve literally only gotten out of bed to get coffee and go to the dentist and the rest of the time I just spend in my bed alternating between sobbing and scrolling on TikTok. When I’ve been out too I just have to fight back tears (lol trying not to cry in the dentist chair is so embarrassing). I also just don’t get why I feel like this because nothing is really wrong in my life. I have a wealthy family and have had basically everything I wanted and needed my entire life. My parents love me and support me and I’ve had a lot of friends growing up (after high school not so many, and now only a couple, but that’s kinda my own fault). So apart from being lacking in the friendship department, everything is great, yet I still just feel this black hole and hatred inside me. Like I’m so lucky and I should be happy and having fun enjoying my life but I can’t because I hate myself and then because I can’t I hate myself more. Same with everyone in my life, they think I’m so happy and bubbly and doing so well but Im not. I just don’t know.  

I have tried therapy before but my therapists have just been rough and I’ve never built a connection with any of them. And it’s so fucking exhausting to have to reach out to therapists explain my issues and then literally PAY for some out of touch old fuck to tell me to try breathing exercises and walking. I also really struggle with opening up to anyone which is why I’m here. I feel like I should get on some sort of medication but because these are just episodes I don’t know.

I 16M got out of relationship 2 months ago and it lasted 2 years. I turn 17 in October. I ended it bc she was so dependent on the relationship that it was draining and I felt like it was a relationship based off of attachment not respect and that she wanted everything to be a fairy tale relationship and we were heading in different directions in life. She still ""loved"" me and made a huge deal about the breakup but then a month later she's with another dude.
I wanted to get a relationship for a In bit honestly for sexual reasons, but the girl I was talking to went and made out with some other guy. I stopped talking to her and I spent some time being single and realized that I had a shallow mindset of women. I have always believed in god but I strayed from him in my previous relationship because the sexual temptation was right there and so easy to fall to. Now, I am trying to get closer to god and live a life that honors him. I am trying to beat lust and reprogram how l look at women. I want to look at women as other people enjoying and living life not just bodies. I also realized that I want a relationship that honors god and is for the right reasons and actual care and love. I feel so sad and lonely right now and just want someone to care. I want someone to genuinely love me and not for attachment and dependent reasons like my old relationships.

1m8rb9p,Is this guy also a gold digger or snob?,"So I’m dating a guy, he’s constantly mentioning almost all the women he dated before, kinda sounds like he is bragging about his sexual life. He often describes the women he dated were all bitches with ill intentions and bad behaviors, while he usually mentions one of the women he dated has a really powerful father who works as a top leader in some top government department, the looks on his face everytime he talked about this “father” is so proud, as if that is his father, almost like he is flying over the Himalayas, and he often mentioned this woman solving life troubles by asking her father, and that this father can solve his troubles by one single phone call, you should see the look on his face when he said that. I can tolerate a man talks about his dating history a little bit, but I don’t fancy it when he talks about his date’s powerful and rich family, sounds like he is a pu**y that wants to marry into a rich family to change his social class. And you know what? I found out most women he dated are from rich families, by rich I mean the women at least do not need to work and can live on their parents in their own country. He laughs at women who are contractors at his company, makes fun of men from crappy schools, and talks much more passionately with people studied abroad and even added their social media. And he often told me there are many female gold diggers tried to treat him like an ATM machine, such as letting him paid for dinner worthy of around $30USD. But he lets me pay for his food many times and even asked me to help him pay for his phone bills, I don’t want to argue about this kind of money with him so I pretend nothing happened, but deep down I really feel like he is more and more like a pu*sy and tight ass, I’m losing my respect to him.

I've explicitly told these two women in the past I don't want anything to do with them after I gave them a chance even though they were acting extremely weird.  Long story short, its been months of being spying on, slandered and also seeing my neighbours being tortured for helping me in this situation.  I tried to placate them and apologise for the situation but the bizarre behaviour continued.  I've reported to everyone I can report to.  The police, my housing association numerous times.  It wasn't taken seriously. I finally snapped and I cursed them all out. I ended up getting arrested spent a night in a cell. Luckily I was only hit with a public order offence.  I still have to go to court for this. Last but not least the housing association calls me today to try and pressure me over this situation. I didn't assault them, all I did was give them a piece of their medicine now I'm in the wrong.  If I was a woman this situation would have been dealt with expeditiously, but because I'm a man I just have to suck it up. This is why men go crazy.

1m8r7c2,My ex-fiancé is undiagnosed,"I believe he has developed schizophrenia over the past year. He has auditory hallucinations. Today he confined in me and told me that amongst many other things, these voices (men), have told him that they’re gonna kill him and that he should kill himself. He said it causally when I asked him if these “people” have ever told him to hurt himself. He said “oh yeah” like he’s used to it. They’ve told him he’d be doing everyone a favor if he killed himself. He hears them talking to him all day. He says he wakes up to them and falls asleep to them. I can’t even imagine the turmoil he must be facing and it breaks my heart.

These are so real to him, I want to approach this in a manner where he knows I believe him and that I’m on his side. I actually got our conversation recorded in case of anything. I’m trying to convince him to see a psychiatrist so he can get some medication that can help him “beat” these voices and these “men” who won’t leave him alone. He’s just convinced these “men” are running an experiment  and can talk through other people and that that will happen with the doctor. What can I do to help him? Can he be forced to be diagnosed and medicated? I don’t want him to feel like I’m betraying him, so that’s why I want to see if I can gently convince him to go on his own, but if it comes down to it, I want to find a way to have it be forced onto him for his own sake.

1m8r327,Wild how someone can mean the world to you… and then act like you never existed.,"Imagine giving someone your time, your energy, your loyalty—only to have them erase you like you never mattered.

Seven months. That’s how long we were together. Late-night talks, shared dreams, emotional highs and lows. Real moments. Real connection. Or at least, I thought so.

Now she’s with someone else. And when people ask, she says we were never even a thing.

And that’s the part that really gets to me. I gave her the best I could, even if I wasn’t perfect. She saw the real me—flawed, trying, still figuring things out—but I showed up for her in the only way I knew how.

And now, it’s like none of it ever meant anything. We “never” happened.

Meanwhile, I’m trying to pick up the pieces. I’m in therapy. I’m back in the gym. I’m eating right, training hard, changing how I show up in the world. I’m getting leaner, stronger, quieter. People say I look better, sound better, seem better.

But every night I still dream about her. Sometimes it’s good—like nothing ever fell apart. Other times it’s me watching her be happy with someone else, and waking up feels like getting punched in the chest.

I know I’ll get through this. I know one day she’ll think back and realize what she lost. But right now? It just hurts.

I’m not writing this for sympathy. I just needed to let it out. Maybe someone out there gets it",1,1,1753421965.0,mentalhealth,Nervous_Maximum_4822,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8r327/wild_how_someone_can_mean_the_world_to_you_and/,2025-07-25T09:58:12.000342

We had to move out of our shared apartment and back into our parents houses for financial reasons. Being separated from him is causing me intense anxiety and low self-esteem. I know that is not healthy and it’s making me reflect on how much I have tried to work on my mental health and how much I am still suffering. 

I started psychiatric medications at 8 years old and therapy at 10 years old. I have tried dozens of psychiatric medicines and numerous medication combinations. I am on luvox and trileptal and they are the most effective medicine combination I ever took and I am still an anxious codependent wreck when it comes to my boyfriend. I have tried monthly therapy, weekly therapy, different therapists, different therapy techniques, and none of them are super effective. 

I had blood tests and take supplements to correct low vitamin D and low iron and I’m still anxious. I have made significant progress with my chronic pain and have many recent personal successes. I exercise everyday and have made progress on improving my diet. But I am still hopelessly suffering from my anxiety.

1m8ln3q,I don't want to fight anymore,"28M. No career, no friends, no job, no car, living with family.

I've always been a introvert person whichI may know the reason but when I fixed it the trauma was already done.

I was ghosted by my childhood friends at the age of 16 when I fail the academic year then, I escaped into video games and I isolated myself. 
Between this age and 19yrs I was only thinking how to disappear but I was a coward. Either school nor family tried to help me, although I didn't ask for it.

At 19yr I moved with my family to a English speaker country where I started working in unskilled jobs, I've never lasted more than 6 months in a single job tbh, every morning I woke up and had anxiety only thinking about working in something I didn't like..
I've always been a solitary person, going from home to work and work to home.

2 years ago I was diagnosed with a disease that make me feel physically exhausted when I have flares-up and I get tired really fast. So I haven't able to work since then.

Now finally, I know what really like to study, so, I applied to the university but I was rejected because my qualifications aren't good enough, I didn't study when I should have and now I'm facing the consequences.

I'm in the same point I was 10 years ago, whilst my  former ""friends"" have a career and even children and I have nothing.

I'm only thinking in take a bus to the farest place and disappear, it's not worth continuing to live without a purpose. I'm tired. I just want to be a normal person.

1m8q2s4,Possibly accidentally triggered my friend. Need Advice? (Possible CW: Contamiation OCD),"Hi, so sorry if this is weird format. I've never posted on Reddit before, only lurked. But I'm worried I may have sent a pic to my friend with Contamination OCD that might trigger her because I didn't think about it. And I'm freaking out about it!

Also I'm sorry if none of this makes sense. I'm both neurodivergent and really high.

I had sent a texted a picture to my friend of a table of contents of a book a mutual friend wrote this chapter in and I didn't realize in the background there were some stains. She has Contamination OCD when I went to text her again about something else (yeah, I know. Double text! Guilty. /g) I saw the stains on the image. She hasn't seen the text, but I'm worried about whether or not this might trigger her. And wondering how I best respond in both apology and offering support?

Is there any legitimacy to that concern? Am I spiraling??? Or just high??? 

Also, if there is legitimacy, between the multiple rabbit holes I fell into (e.g. how to unsend an image), and just trying to make sure all this made sense due to the above mentioned neurodivergence and really high combo, the amount of time it took to get this all out is freaking me out even more!",1,2,1753418526.0,mentalhealth,Emotional_Guava_3670,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8q2s4/possibly_accidentally_triggered_my_friend_need/,2025-07-25T09:58:12.000342

Alcohol doesn’t currently negatively affect my life, but I don’t know if it’s normal to be so unhappy with myself when I’ve not had a drink. 

I’ve made huge strides in my mental health to stop a nicotine addiction and get myself off of anti-psychotic medication which I was prescribed to help with anxiety/stress induced ticks/Tourette’s.

I have a stable job, an amazing girlfriend and mother. I don’t have any good reason to be so unhappy. 

And I certainly don’t have a reason to drink so much alcohol. For the last 6 months I’ve drank whiskey every night. I probably drink between 1-2 bottles of jack Daniel’s in a week.

1m8pyu6,Mental health advice.,"I just recently burnt my whole life down because it didnt feel right. I feel like i fail at everything to the point where I won't take new opportunities. I've let anyone who isn't a close friend go.  With the exception of reddit I've deleted all my social media. I feel like I've withdrawn from life.  I only clean the parts of my house that other people see and sometimes I can't even brush my damn teeth. I have diagnosed ADHD but I can't help but think something else is wrong with me.  This all started with the wedding.  I love my husband but my family pressured me into a huge wedding I couldn't afford.  I was so stressed from it I started avoiding my mother's emails and calls.  I never wrote thank you cards because just the thought of the wedding made me feel sick. And then my family and a few friends shamed me for not sending them. Shortly after the wedding I became pregnant. 3 months later I lost the baby. I went back home thinking spending time with my family would help me get through it. Instead I was constantly reminded of the god damned thank you cards. My grandma paraded every old lady I never met through her living room while I was bleeding and losing my baby saying ""since you don't have time to send a card you can say thank you now."" It sucked. Then I lost my job due to doge. It was a job with a very particular skill set that I thought I'd have till retirement. My skills and experience are completely irrelevant to any other job. I now work in a kitchen where my body hurts and I get treated like garbage by customers. I work several other part time jobs as well to make ends meet. About a month after I lost my job I was hit in a head on collision while working. The person who hit me was driving on the wrong side of the road on a blind turn. My personal vehicle was totaled. I had several medical issues the months following. At this point I was feeling extremely overwhelmed so I hired a lawyer to help me navigate everything. This was three months ago and we have gotten no where. Communication is non existent and they have stopped responding to my emails. Obviously i need to drop this lawyer but I am so tired and I have no motivation and I just want somewhere warm and dark to hide. I feel so alone in this.

1m8pa1o,"Intrusive thoughts during prayer for years, feel trapped in guilt. Is there a way out","Hello everyone,
I’m dealing with something that’s been quietly affecting my life for years, and I finally feel ready to talk about it.

Back in 2020, I watched a few web series that had a lot of slang. Over time, some of those words got stuck in my mind. I never spoke them out loud, but they'd pop up in my thoughts - especially during stress or conflict.

The issue is, these words now show up when I pray or chant God's name. It feels like I'm mentally insulting something sacred, even though I don’t want to. The harder I try to push these thoughts away, the more they show up. It’s been almost 5 years, and it’s created a loop of guilt and shame I can’t seem to escape.

Lately, it’s gotten worse. I catch myself thinking things like “let something bad happen to me, while seeing god's picture or videos. My mind consistently pray to god, let something bad happen to me. I find find myself cursing me”, I know these thoughts aren’t me, but they still come - uninvited and loud.

I’m sharing this to ask:

Has anyone else experienced something like this?

How did you deal with it?

Did therapy actually help?

1m8otk1,Playing video games makes me feel empty and frustrated.,"I'm only 21 years old, and lately I've felt like things aren't going my way. I'm at a point in my life where my head is often filled with worries, and one of those worries is that I no longer enjoy playing video games like I used to. I don't know how silly it sounds or how stupid you may think it is, but I usually play games with competitive themes. So, when I finish playing and achieve a victory for myself and my team, I can't help but feel empty, sad, and frustrated. I can't help but play games without feeling guilty. And honestly, sometimes, to avoid thinking about anything else and forget about my problems, I resort to playing video games. I used to exercise and was in really good physical shape. I used to lift weights, but even that didn't make me feel good. Every time I finished working out, the bad thoughts would return. I don't know how you see it, but I believe that when you're feeling bad and someone recommends the gym, it probably won't help. I'm not saying this to offend anyone; I just think that when someone is in a bad mental state, it's hard to continue finding some things to satisfy you. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I haven't exercised or eaten well for months, and like I said before, I don't even enjoy video games; on the contrary, they make me hate myself.

I want to leave this to read your analysis and see some advice from people who have lived a similar experience. I don't know what the hell is really going on with me. I don't go to therapy because the situation in my country makes it difficult to see a psychologist. But anyway, I hope to read your answers.

1m8h1w8,Why do I feel like I cannot even never be good at anything or satisfied with anything that I do in life?,"I’m 28 and I feel like I was so much more productive and smarter when I was younger (18-25). I just kind of feel like the failures in life have taken a mental toll on me and now I’ve just come to feel like I can never do anything good. I also feel like I have perfectionism and that any compliment people give me I don’t deserve, the things I mess up make me feel like I’m a burden to others, other people’s negative feedback or criticism sends me into a deep spiral of emotions where I feel unwanted, I feel like I’m LITERALLY USELESS and GOOD FOR NOTHING. I’ve tried to “snap myself out of this” and that doesn’t go further than me telling myself verbally to snap out of it and then going back to feeling like shit. Other habits I’ve tried to inculcate in myself like trying g to eat better, exercise regularly, walk regularly, appreciate myself, etc. nothing seems to stick. I feel like nothing brings me joy, and even if I am happy in a certain moment, it feels very fleeting and almost like I don’t deserve to even feel happy about that moment.

1m8olot,I feel like I’m mentally melting but no one can tell. Has anyone else felt like this?,"Hey everyone. I’m struggling to explain this feeling, but I’ll try anyway.

It’s like I’m mentally melting — I feel completely aware of everything all the time, like hyper-aware. My body moves fine, I talk to people normally, but inside it’s like I’m turning into a zombie. Not in a dramatic way — just this slow, creeping hollowing-out, like something is eating me from the inside without leaving a mark.

Sometimes I zone out for like 10 minutes and just… don’t think. I’m staring at something, breathing, existing, but not there. Then I snap back in and wonder where the hell I just went.

It’s a weird contradiction. I feel too conscious, like my brain is running at full volume, but at the same time I feel numb, distant, like I’m disappearing. I’m functioning, but it doesn’t feel real anymore.

I don’t know if this is dissociation, burnout, or something else entirely. I haven’t talked to anyone in real life about it. I’m scared they’ll just say “you seem fine” and brush it off. But I don’t feel fine.

This year’s been rough I’ve missed a lot of work like multiple weeks mostly from mental health stuff like anxiety, depression, panic attacks, burnout and also migraines. I didn’t just ghost my job I went through the process and took protected leave trying to do everything the right way. Now that I’m in a better headspace I keep looking back and feeling overwhelmed by how much time I missed, and how much I’ve let everyone down.

Every time I see stats on how most people only miss a few days a year it messes with my head, because I’ve missed over a month of work. But at the time I felt like I couldn’t do it, could barely get out of bed. I honestly don’t know how I kept going or got to the other side of this. Somehow I’m still employed but I keep wondering if I’m about to be let go or if I already messed up my future without realizing it. 

If anyone’s been through something like this missing way more work than what’s normal but still trying to come back from it I’d really appreciate hearing from you. Just trying to figure out what’s next and not feel so alone in it. I go back next week and am super anxious and want to see how others handled a similar situation.

1m8jpyu,Is there something legitimately wrong with me or am I fine?if so how do I got about changing my ways?,"I am not sure how to describe what I believe is wrong with me it might be something very simple or something so over complicated and absurd that it can’t be categorized into a mental illness but. I just can’t seem to function like a normal person my head is constantly filled with thoughts from the moment I wake up to the moment i try to sleep. And it seems to always be the same thing or similar but constantly worrying about how I present myself to other people or not want to do something because it’s out of character which is a shy, quiet, timid dude who doesn’t say much. Why?because I am always worried about failing something no matter how small or big the thing may be I always worry that I will fuck it up and embarrass myself more something as simple as rehearsing how to loudly say good morning to my coworkers when they always say it to me I respond with hey instead good morning back or how to speak up in general or how to speak to a girl. Or when I walk down the sidewalk or cross the street I constantly assume that all the cars are looking at me judging the way I walk or how my hair gets messed up in the wind and I look stupid or how big I am or awkward, I worry what I am wearing is good or not or if I look stupid. 


Not to mention I can’t make a decision for the life of me I always hesitate and end up settling for less or something I didn’t want and constantly asking others is the decision I made good and trying to seek approval for something I did on my own. Or how I never eat lunch during my breaks at work because I don’t want people to see what I get. I also really only workout and go to the gym so girls will like me and that if one day if I ever get far enough with someone that when it gets intimate I look good without clothes on instead of just working out and being healthy just for the sake of myself. 

I really really dislike myself i don’t like that I was born this way I hate my mindset and I don’t have the slightest clue how to stop and I don’t want to ask for help because I am an adult I am 21 I shouldn’t be this way because I am too old to be constantly worried about what others think and instead I should be firm and confident but when I try to be I mess it up and look stupid or goofy. Even my appearance i spent so much money on clothes and cosmetic products to try and make myself look somewhat decent or attractive enough to maybe if I ever get the confidence to approach a girl I look somewhat presentable.

I wouldn’t say it’s like this everyday or as bad as it sounds now it’s still there just a more shallow version but nonetheless still something I think about everyday worrying about what others think, don’t have the confidence to speak up, haven’t made decent enough progress in my life to feel like i fit in with everyone else who lives normal lives. Having their first cars, apartments, dream jobs, girlfriends , boyfriends, and me sitting here still with my mom no dad guess he didn’t want to stick around taking the bus to work, working at a grocery store as a full time cashier cuz I got kicked out of college, no real goals or desires just trying to make as much money as I can before I have to decide what I want to do.

I don’t know what’s the issue or even where to start fixing all this crap but i would appreciate some tips or advice if anyone has suggestions. Thanks in advance.

1m8o78k,"I hate antipsychotic medication but I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder, Do you think its possible to stave off psychosis with cognitive awareness and a clean lifestyle and not need meds??","I am a 47-year-old male who started to have mental health problems at the age of 31 after divorce and work issues. Schizoaffective and Bipolar spectrum disorders are very complex and hard to diagnose. After my divorce in 2009, I started to take Vyvanse to focus better at work. It turned out to be a big mistake, which, along with alcohol use, triggered a psychotic episode. It started when I returned from work. As I walked into my apartment, I began to hear my coworkers' voices in my head. I attributed it to work stress because each episode starts off in a real sneaky way. I was watching TV and political events, and through my imagination, I started to create a mental narrative that the voices I heard were actually some attack from the government. So, from the 2009 State of the Union, I have developed this psychotic storyline that the government is using my mind as some sort of technical advancement strategy. I'm currently in a remission period and don't have any symptoms, but when something happens that I believe to be deceptive I will return to this story's origin in 2009 and the whole thing becomes reality again being used by the government and all my attention is diverted to fighting for my freedom from this cognitive enslavement from the government. 

So, from 2009-2025, I get triggered by some stressful situation and start to believe this government context again. The advancement of technology is not good for psychotic government beliefs because it makes all things possible, and it provides proof that the psychotic belief is really happening. For some reason, when I disprove the government theory, it erases the psychotic belief and basically cures the illness. So, I guess what I am asking people is when I see through the voices, officially knowing they're manufactured from my own brain and not some government technology, my disease and psychosis disappear. I feel like a sucker who has wasted so much time with these false beliefs. 

So, when I see through it, I don't have Schizoaffective Disorder. Is that really having this disorder, or am I misdiagnosed? I don't like any of the medication I have tried; I have tried them all except the new Cobenfy. I can't function on the Dopamine blocker medication. I don't need medication until something stressful happens and voices or brain stress trick me into believing this government storyline. My most recent episode started on Labor Day and ended about two months ago. Presently, I don't need that medication. I know it's not a true storyline. So my Affective disorder is dormant, like I don't have a serious mental health disorder at all, yet I was hospitalized 12 times in the last 16 years, most of the time against my will. Each time I have to dig out and start over, rebuild my career and relationship status. **Any advice on preventing these false beliefs from resurrecting themselves and destroying my life again??????**",1,1,1753412594.0,mentalhealth,Jonnnytwotimes23,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8o78k/i_hate_antipsychotic_medication_but_i_was/,2025-07-25T09:58:12.000342
1m8jdym,Im a schizo,"Hi I'm a 28M and in disbelief that I might or do have schizo. A little back story; a few years ago me and my buddies and their mutuals went on a camping trip to Yosemite. My friend invited me to do take some Marijuana/shrooms/dummies. I wasn't an avid user so my endurance to side effects is very low. I may have overdone it and triggered something in my brain. I start hallucinating, saying stuff with no thought behind it and I was gaining consciousness in sporadic periods. I was scared, I didn't like how I felt so I went inside my tent to sleep it off. Ever since then I was never the same. Little bits of those side effects stay to me to this day without drug use. Especially with me saying random shit, I don't even know if I'm saying nice things or horrible things I can't even imagine coming out of my mouth. Fast forward to today, sleep deprivation makes it easy for me to have these type of episodes. I just had one today and freaked out all my co workers. I don't know how to show my face tomorrow. I heard someone in the background say ""he's just a chill guy, probably the most normal guy out of all of us"". Just hearing that made me confirm that I did indeed have an episode. On top of that the guys face in front of me was just in shock and disgust. I have not gone to see a doctor or psychiatrist because I don't have insurance yet. I just got the job and I'm worried I might lose it if I inform my supervisor of my situation. Do I shrugg it off and go back to work? Also if you are in the bay area, specifically in sj/milpitas please recommend me a good psychiatrist that won't hurt the bank if I choose to visit without insurance, or if you know how much it would generally cost in this area.

1m7sipu,I survived a psychiatric emergency — but only barely,"The Issue

On July 4, 2025, I suffered a sudden and severe mental health crisis triggered by an adverse reaction to an over-the-counter cold medicine. I was hallucinating, panicked, and rushed to the ER with a blood pressure of 190/100. I was discharged after six hours — with no psychiatric consult, no safety net, and no follow-up.

What came next nearly killed me.
For three days, I couldn’t eat or drink. I begged for help. I reached out to my provider. I saw a psychiatrist. I told them the medications they prescribed previously caused serious side effects. I asked for lithium, a drug that had worked before.
The response?
“Your next appointment is in three weeks.”
I was in full psychological collapse — and told to wait.

I’m not alone. This is happening across North Carolina and the United States every day. People in active crisis are being told to survive on their own until the system can “get to them.” Some don’t survive.

We demand change — now.

We call on North Carolina legislators and the NC Department of Health and Human Services to:
Mandate emergency triage protocols for psychiatric care.

- Patients in crisis must be prioritized within 24–72 hours — not weeks.
- Fund and expand bridge-care programs.
Patients should receive short-term prescriptions or crisis stabilization while awaiting follow-up.
- Hold providers accountable for medication safety.
When patients report severe side effects, they must be heard and alternative treatments offered.
Train employers on trauma-informed response.
Employees experiencing mental health emergencies need compassion, not productivity pressure.
 Support caregivers.
Partners, family members, and friends who hold us up through crisis deserve resources and recognition.
I’m not asking for sympathy.
I’m demanding action.
I survived the waitlist — but just barely. Let’s make sure no one else has to.

Also I can get quite sad when someone attacks me indirectly(the best example I can think of is that I am a Christian so when i see someone insulting every Christian by saying something like you all belive in fairy tales (which is ok everbody has their opinion and they can say whatever they want and maybe they are right) but I just take it too seriously and i feel that is causing me a problem)). Also for some reason I can get very sad when somebody has a different view than me on other things which I think shouldn't be the case and i should learn to listen to everybody's opinion and not get mad(politics). So how can I be more ignorant of the things happening around me because I am very sensitive person and I always was and I am in a bad mood and dont have the will to do anything. I tried distancing myself from reading things like that but I always seem to go back to reading them so can somebody help me with that.

Also I am not a native English speaker so some sentences are not worded how I wanted them but I tried to write it the best I could without any help from the internet and its tools so that I could transfer my emotions better. So if something is unclear i will try to explain it better and please be respectful I am tierd of people hating on other people.",3,8,1753389165.0,mentalhealth,Kamego123,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8fh2q/can_you_give_me_some_advice/,2025-07-25T09:58:12.000342

1m8ewni,i need guidance please i can’t seem to get anything done anymore i don’t know how to get help,sorry for bad writing i’m not really well right now. i’m a 25 year old man and my mental health has been ruining my life. the past few years i’ve only been getting worse. i need somebody to explain me what is this that i’m going through please. i am facing this same pattern everytime everyday. whenever i try to do anything say it be studying or exercising or socializing or anything totally casual like cleaning i immediately get frustrated like my brain feels exploding and then i end up stressed and suicidal and then i have to do every impulsive thing in the world from smoking drinking and binging on food to weird sexual things just so i can recharge and feel a bit more normal again. it’s still the same if i force myself to go on or if i’m forced by someone. it happened many times back then and it always ends bad for me. my ideal living condition would be in a small cell with no sound and no nothing. i can’t handle the sounds from streets anymore. i can’t handle people’s presence. i’m unemployed and i have no social life left. my parents are taking care of me currently but i will have to get back on my feet because it’s not sustainable and i want to be able to live my life again. i need guidance thank you. i want to live,3,3,1753387839.0,mentalhealth,Illustrious-Dig-4362,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8ewni/i_need_guidance_please_i_cant_seem_to_get/,2025-07-25T09:58:12.000342

Sitting lonely in my bed wondering why the warmthof love hasn't touched me why does it always shy away from me what do I do to deserve compassion and a need to be wanted by someone to be held by some one and to melt in his arms or to be kissed like tomorrow does not exist 
Things dont value anymore first it was the tuition boy who was the source of oxygen to me but then he failed to suffice the need of air he extinguished the warmth of love from my heart and left me in ruins and as I took a month to collect the ruins of me it again reignited when I met a boy on insta who tried to escalate my pain into happiness but you know what they say abt attraction it cannot be turned to love even if imposed upon cut to two months in I realised the fire again burning out and the lights flickering leading me to darkness once again but one of toxic traits made me to get back with my  tuition ex i thought it would make sense with him but it did not he made me hate myself even more and used to manipulate me into thinking that what I did to him was something extremely cruel but he till now hasn't realised that the person to blame all along was him he made me cry  and pretended to care acted like the most sweetest person to exist when we met and then while texting he used to make me feel like the person who does not deserve to be loved and it was true that I regret my relationship with the boy i met on insta but everyone makes mistakes it is just that some realise them a bit too later to rverse their actions but they try to and which is what i did myself but he made me regret it and also as time passed by he made me question my efforts and said they were trivial as to what he did for me said that he didn't matter to me which was the biggest lie but amidst this I forced myself out lost many bitchy friends and realised what it is to stay contented with myself and cut to today I believe I took the right decision by distancing myself from relationships till I achieve my target and then find someone who accepts me turns the hate and disgust I feel for myself to something beautiful make me believe that god has in store a person for each one us who will suddenly enter our life and make us forget everything only to start afresh and bloom with love

1m8mzc9,Where do I go for help?,"To preface this, I (22M) just went through a breakup which has plummeted my self confidence for a number of reasons. Which is crazy because I’m not even mad about the break up. I don’t miss her. I’m glad it’s over because it was toxic. But now my self confidence is so low and I don’t know what to do. Got back on the dating app and had a date planned and she canceled on me (this certainly didn’t help). I’ve been going to the gym but that hasn’t helped. Listening to motivational podcasts. I can’t go to my friends because I don’t want to be judged or feel like a burden to them.
I feel like a lot of the stuff I’m going through has a lot to do with the pressures that society puts on men. We are taught to be tough and not show emotions. We are taught we have to be the provider and be strong and all these other things. And on top of all of that, nobody gives a shit about what you’re going through. They all tell you to suck it up or you’ll be fine. 
I just don’t know where to go for help. I feel like there aren’t enough resources out there for men’s mental health and I really just don’t know what else to do besides keep pushing through it on my own.",1,8,1753408968.0,mentalhealth,First_Tell,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8mzc9/where_do_i_go_for_help/,2025-07-25T09:58:13.311373

My eldest being 18 and youngest being 5. Ive always done it alone. Financially the burden is more than i can describe. The father has always been absent physically and financially. In February he suddenly made an appearance and wants to be in their lives (not financially of course) within a week of having them my sons appendix burst and had to have emergency surgery and my daughter was fatigued, feverish and emotional. From there its been a downward spiral of his affect on the children, his harassment, bullying and abuse of me and further financial neglect. I am sole custodian, and while i initially thought his involvement would be a good thing, it's reached a point where i have blocked access until a legal access and maintenance document is signed and court ordered, for my protection and stability and for my babies. He has now started applying for shared custody. All these court proceedings are killing me and financially i am down to absolutely nothing. I have no family or support, except a couple of friends who have helped. Ive had to break my soul to ask for help but i cant put more strain on the people who have actually been there.

Birthdays have turned into a kick in the stomach for me.  This year was the worst.  The only time my phone made any noise today was when my narcissistic mother sent me a TEXT to wish me a happy birthday.  Couldn't even get that woman to DIAL!  Oh, and my exbf did text me as well to make sure I got a refill on my pain meds so he could have them.  

I did go to my one-on-one mental health rehabilitation today.  I felt like a first grader in school telling everyone it was my birthday so at least I'd get a little attention.  

""Oh, but you got Facebook Happy Birthdays!"" yeah, I don't count those.  FB tells you it's someones birthday so all you have to do is click a button.  They really don't mean anything to me.  

And I am such a disappointing adult.  I'm on disability which if anyone knows SSI, it's almost impossible to live on that.  I can't make it a month.  Currently I have no food, no toilet paper, no one that cares.  Yes, I do food shelves but that only goes so far when you are single and they barely want to give you anything.  All because I decided not to have children because I can't take care of myself!!  I haven't eaten today.  Happy Freaking Birthday!

And then I worry about my little brother and I keep imagining him >! Stepping out infront of a train !< due to bullying at school. Or breaking into a store >! Stealing a gun and shooting himswld!< but this isn’t for a few years.

And my mum works as an itu nurse in ambulances, and I keep worrying about her getting driven off the road. Or when I was 13 my mum said she wanted to >! Hang her self from a tree !< because of me and I keep getting dreams where this happens.

And my step mums an alcoholic and I keep dreaming that she >! Smashes both my little brother and sisters heads in with a wine bottle!< or the house >!burns down !< with both my little brother and sister in there. And there bodies aren’t even identifiable because they’re so badly burned.

1m8lbv8,Why am I so unmotivated outside of work?,"I don’t understand why I have no motivation for anything anymore. 

I have a Monday-Thursday, 10 hour shift job with good pay, benefits and engaging workload. I perform well, engage with my peers and find myself satisfied with my work daily. I enjoy it, and I love throwing myself at a new challenge and learning new things.

The problem is, that ends at work. As soon as I am out of it, I don’t want to do anything. I have no motivation for anything. No urgency. I know I have to clean up around, but I feel apprehensive of doing it. Even if I start something, it doesn’t take long for me to have no energy or motivation to finish. 

I feel gross, but I still don’t do anything and I wish I could explain better what it feels like. It upsets me but I also don’t feel like doing something about it. I can sit and write out everything I need to do and how, but actually doing it feels like something crawling under my skin. I hate it. Yet at work? I go above and beyond and I want that to be my life always.

1m8fl8r,How to deal with OCD and anxiety?,"Anxiety overwhelms me at times, gripping me so tightly it feels unbearable. 

The heart palpitations are intense, sometimes so severe I fear my heart might stop.

I lie awake at night, unable to sleep, my mind spiraling as it replays the same distressing thoughts over and over.

At this point, it’s hard to believe anything could stop me from feeling this way every night, because—it’s so deeply embedded in my psyche and my body feels like its deterioration as a result. 

I struggle to focus, to truly care about things the way I once did. 

Paying attention or engaging in conversations feels impossible, as if my brain has short-circuited from the weight of dealing with these issues for so long.

For realizing that I am truely alone in this world and I have nobody to talk to or who cares to understand and make it better. 

I have panic attacks so frequently. Almost every night. Sometimes goes away for a month or two and then its back again, especially in winter. 

Imagine being made/left to feel this way for years. 

People just don't care, if it doesn't affect them. Imagine how bad it must be for someone to truely suffer like this. 

For YEARS. 

I have tried calming my mind through mediation, which I can't do because I am always thinking about multiple things at once, and I used to be able to keep track. I do have Adhd or something but I could swop between seperate conversations, etc and carry them, like normal. Always thought it was a talent. Can't do it so well anymore. 

I often get lost in multiple trains of thought, ideas, mental visuals and images so vivid its hard to comeback to reality. 

Often triggered when I get upset or have bad thoughts. I get triggered my OCD and the same reoccurring bad thoughts. It's truelly terrible. The more I try to force them out, the more they stay in my mind. 

Many years ago I was put on medication after an emotional breakdown that resulted in me not eating. I just woke up one day and stopped eating, it didn't even feel like a decision, I didnt need to eat. I can't explain it. I didn't even really feel hungry. I lost 22kg in 2-3 months. The pills helped, I took them for 3 years, but it was a complete mistake to take them for so long especially once I was better mentally. 

They make me completely emotionless, like I was floating watching my numb self going through the same old routine. I fake laughed, ate and smiled but there was nothing else going on, I didnt even realize that everything was running on autopilot so to speak or I suppose I didn't care. I only came to realize how terrible it is when I stopped taking them. I was alone, 90% of the time at college with no friends, shut off, in my room, nobody noticed anyway. 

It just feel like I am dealt the wrong end of every stick in certain situations. What do I do. 

It painful, it doesn't stop. I feel like my body is going to given up eventually. 

I am at the point where I get this weird pulse feeling in my hands and feet sometimes l, when I get even the slightest shock or fright. Like while driving. It's never happened before but the past 6 months, it been happening.

1m8fglw,a puzzle that I am trying to figure out as a teenager,"Sometimes I feel like I live inside my feelings more than reality.
I don’t daydream — I just feel things too much, too fast.
I connect with certain people deeply, and when it doesn’t go how I hoped, it messes with me.
It’s not about being dramatic — it’s just how I’m wired.

I protect my energy hard.
If someone doesn’t match how I see things, I pull away.
It’s not coldness — it’s self-preservation.

I’ve been trying to find someone who mirrors me.
But no one ever really does. And that’s been the hardest part.

Still, I love hard. Even when things start unreal, my heart’s in the right place.
I’m just now realizing: maybe the world I built in my head to feel safe…
has actually been what’s hurting me. At first I didn't even realize I had always been in my head. I thought I was just being who I am. Thought I was normal. But now that I really think about it, it is kinda psychic and it kinda freaks me out.

1m8eiia,Am i ever going to forgive myself?,I did something terrible and i lost someone who really cared about me. I have a drinking problem and drug habit im coming to terms with. Ive made plenty of bad decisions wasted and high but i think this takes the cake. I cheated on my bf while i was drunk with a drug dealer that sells the drugs that i do. I'm filled with immense shame and disgust towards myself. I told him the day after it happened because it was eating at me so badly and watching him lovingly interact with me made me hate myself so hard. He just told me to gtfo and that's completely understandable. He blocked me on everything and i was spiraling so i was attempting to contact him through other phone numbers and i finally got a response but it was that we are done and to leave him alone. I threw away something that meant so much to me for what? I feel like hurting myself but at the same time i feel stupid for being so sad because what about him? I have been cheated on so i know how that can hurt. I have made the decision to stop contacting him as i know its probably making things worse. I haven't stopped crying for days and i really feel like this shame spiral is fucking with my head bad. I truly loved him and now I feel empty with nothing but my harsh thoughts. I'm devastated and I feel like i cant live with myself anymore. I know i have to channel this energy into becoming a better person and i plan to but will i ever allow myself to receive anything good again? I sure don't deserve it. I have struggled with self harm and suicidal ideation for many years and those have been the two main solutions i have given myself with all this happening. My friends are taking turns making sure im not alone and have been supporting me through this but it kind of makes me feel worse knowing that he needs that support too and idk if he's getting it. Like it should be him not me that they're concerned about :( I feel like a piece of trash and how can i continue on like this?

What I’m gonna mention here is, I already mentioned in another post, but I didnt go into details, now I will.

Theres a voice. In my head.

A bad voice, that is super negative. It oftens kind of make me think that my suffering is not valid, because I didnt go through enough. This kind of voice pushes me to hurt myself deeper to have more scars and make my suffering more visible, more real. This voice has also convinced me to attempt, so that my suffering would be more real, like a proof to my suicidal thoughts.

I dont know if its really voice, i dont know how to refer to it… its like… a part of my mind that I dont control? The thoughts are here before I can even stop them.

This kind of voice also pushes me to wanting to have really bad things happening to me…. And I know people would get mad at me if I mentioned WHAT things, they are things that traumatized many people, and I feel ashamed whenever I kind of want it to happen to me.

1m86x1t,I don’t trust my psychiatrist,"F21. Diagnosed with GAD, depression, social anxiety, and strong OCD tendencies (not full OCD). One of my worst obsessions has been schizophrenia-OCD—it’s sent me into awful spirals before, but I’d been slowly getting better. Until now.

For some context: I saw the same psychiatrist for 3–4 years, she was great but a mess with her schedule, so I had to stop. My aunt decided to book me an appointment with a new psychiatrist, I told her I'd like to choose, since I would be the one getting attended but she still booked one without consulting me. I only told her that I'd like someone young, since I feel like it would be easier for me to relate and I've encountered plenty outdated doctors, one of my worst experiences as a kid was with an older psychiatrist, who in response to some suicidal ideas I had, told me to throw myself at the train tracks in some sort of shock therapy (if he meant to help, lol it didnt work), I told her this and they just laughed it off.

I still gave the new guy a shot. He’s dismissive, cold, doesn’t build trust—but I followed through, took the meds, no complaints.

Yesterday was my second appointment, he first asked me if I had still been “angry” or “moody”, which threw me off because that’s just not how I am, the only emotion I showed the previous session was sadness by crying. Then he called it a “miracle” because i had improved my hygiene (i took it as a joke, so i dont mind much but with all things considered now, it does bother me), he ended the session early. I asked him again to give me an  updated diagnose sheet with the medication I need to take to send it to my aunt, to which he replied “No, I dont feel like it”, but offered to include my aunt in the next call so he can explain it to her privately. He seemed in a hurry to end the call. 

He gave me Olanzapine (2.5mg) at night, didn’t explain why. I looked it up—it’s used for psychosis. My brain instantly latched onto it, and now I’m spiraling again, fearing I’m actually psychotic and being lied to. I know it’s probably just for sleep/anxiety/OCD thoughts, but the lack of transparency made everything worse.

I told my aunt and she just said “psychiatrists are like that” and “they’re not here to praise you.” But I don’t want praise—I want to be taken seriously and not treated like a burden. I feel like no one’s listening.

I told my aunt this and she told me thats how psychistrists are, that they are cold and not meant to praise me. But I know that, thats why I always prefer to go to them since they are objective, but Its not true that they have to be cold or dismissive. Anyway, my mental health is deteriorating and i have my next appointment booked already, I will continue because I dont wanna be ungrateful but i do feel very sad. 

TLDR: 21F with anxiety, depression, and OCD fears (esp. schizophrenia). New psychiatrist (booked by my aunt without asking) is cold, dismissive, and won’t explain my diagnosis or meds (prescribed Olanzapine). Now I’m spiraling again.

1m8ibnu,I'm feeling very anxious about moving apartments,"I moved to another city, to this current apartment, because I got a job a year ago. It's been hell in this apartment. Just 5 days after I moved in, a leak started from my bathroom into the ceiling of the apartment below. I had to let strangers in my apartment to fix this. The problem happened 6 months later. I had to let strangers in again and it was so fucked up, I couldn't shower in my house the day the repair was done and I had to travel for the weekend cause I couldn't take a shower, I had to wait for the material to dry.

Next to the building there are some sand volleyball courts and there's LOUD music EVERY SINGLE DAY, MONDAY TO MONDAY, UNTIL 9, 10 PM. It's been hell, I haven't been able to rest here.

When I moved in the neighbours use to be so loud at night. There was a night I woke up 1, 2, 3 AM because of their fucking noises (talking, music, etc.)

My bathroom is fucked. Somehow the water always escapes from the shower stalls and the floor gets a bit flooded. The bathroom is SO DAMP.

There was a time we had no water for three days, three days without taking a shower. I complained to the building management company, they were very negligent, I kept complaining, and in the end they said they would sue me.

About a month an object was robbed in the building (not mine though).

Anyway, I could keep listing things over and over. Only good thing is this place is cheap.

However, I'm moving to a new apartment. It was about time. Plus, a week ago they called and said water was leaking from my bathroom to the downstairs neighbour ceiling again. No way I'll let strangers in again, fuck them, it's the third time in a year, it's their fault, fuck them.

The new place seems ok. However, the rent costs almost twice the current price. But I looked for apartments all over the city, they all seem bad or not okay and are expensive. This one seems ok. The neighbourhood seems ok. I visited the apartment twice, but besides this occasion I also went to the building's street another three or four times, including at night, to make sure the neighbourhood isn't noisy.

I only want peace of mind. My plan when moving to this apartment I am in today was to work, settle my life in the first few months, and then study and try to improve my life. BUT I JUST CAN'T. THIS APARTMENT SCREAMS DEPRESSION. I can't explain, I find it disgusting, I can barely touch things, it makes my skin crawl, I hate it here.

I could keep going on and on here. I'm anxious. I don't know whether it is the right thing to do... I don't want problems anymore. I just want a fucking house where I can get from work, be in silence, touch things without fear, have some peace of mind to study and search for new things to improve my life.",1,1,1753396136.0,mentalhealth,unnamed_op2,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8ibnu/im_feeling_very_anxious_about_moving_apartments/,2025-07-25T09:58:13.311373

And I've been having like I don't know if it's like mental health or whatever but like I'm just like always like worried about. I guess like my job and stuff like that and doing stuff right and correctly and you know the adult things 

I don't feel like I'm always doing things right at work and I try to work harder but like I have a bladder issue that affects how I work. I had to quit one job because of it and now I'm at this other job and I just had this situation today where they just went ahead and told me to leave like they didn't fire me or nothing. They one of the managers just told me to leave and she seemed angry 

Now I don't know what caused the urgency if it was because it was hot in the room or if it's because I drank too much. I tried to stay on medication and I don't think the medication is helping which was prescribed by people who are good with bladder issues 

Now they don't know if it's bladder issues or if it's mental health issues that are affecting my bladder and like targeting my bladder to make it worse. But I just don't know at this point it's like ruined my entire life. It's ruined my way of thinking. I don't like going outside. If I go like say a place is far away then I start to get worried and my bladder gets worse cuz I don't feel like I can hold it 

It wasn't like this before. I mean I used to work my ass off walk 50 minutes to work everyday and just be a normal adult and now I can't even do that. It feels like I'm doing something wrong 

And like I don't like to cry. I don't like to be sad. I don't like to think about that stuff but it like eats at you after time of just sitting there and and realizing you're not the same as you once were 

You're not the same person you have to adapt to whatever is going on with your body and I've tried for like the past 2 years and I just don't want to like I'm not suicidal. I just don't want to put up with the bullshit anymore 


So I don't know where to go. I don't know who to talk to. I don't know how to fix it. If I could fix it I could just go back to having a normal life without having to worry about anything and just doing what needs to get done 

But it's like my brain doesn't work with me or doesn't want to work with me. And I don't know if I'm lazy or whatever but I'm just not the same person I was I'm overweight now. I don't feel healthy

1m8iaas,This world makes sense as a product of psychosis from the angle of my brain.,"I am fanatically opposed to naïve realism which believes that things are as they appear to be. At best our brains project a sufficiently accurate simulation of portions of an external physical world that the limitations of our sense organs are receptive to.

Optical illusions are proof of a distinction between the sensory and the physical. Since I have a schizophrenic brain it makes sense that through that looking glass the world seems like a product of psychosis that reflects my fears and desires as well as my pessimism and cynicism.

Look up the Coffer Illusion under optical illusions. It proves people see reality differently. 
 
In short, those who were raised around architecture with right angles see rectangles whilst those who weren't and are usually in less developed countries see circles when encountering the Coffer Illusion.

The ""Yanny or Laurel"" audio illusion became a viral internet phenomenon in May 2018. It's an auditory ambiguity where some people clearly hear ""Yanny"" and others clearly hear ""Laurel"" when listening to the same audio clip.

Immanuel Kant made a distinction between things as they are experienced which he labeled ""phenomena"" and things as they are independent of all experiences which he called ""noumena.""

I believe that the world I experience is not in fact real because it all lacks objectivity. It's just an arguably inaccurate neurological construct based on the limitations of my sense organs' receptivity, and the world I imagine to be real is no different from a daydream.",1,0,1753396040.0,mentalhealth,KodiZwyx,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8iaas/this_world_makes_sense_as_a_product_of_psychosis/,2025-07-25T09:58:13.311373

1m8c0jq,I have no cluey on what to do,"I (16M) believe that I've been struggling with clinical depression for a few years now. I have never have gotten diagnosed, however, I've shown very obvious symptoms with the main one being a severe lack of motivation. My main problem is I cannot find any ounce of energy to complete any major task for college. I want to change all of this, I want to improve my motivation and my attention span, however I just cannot find the motivation to improve. Horrible cycle I know xD

I have been thinking about going to therapy and getting help more recently, but due to my age I would have to open to my parents and I just have no clue on how it would go down. A main reason I haven't opened up yet to them is because it's always felt like their opinion on it is ""oh end of world if you get depression"" and I don't want to make myself look ""weak"" to them. I try to push myself to complete everything but with responsibilities growing I am becoming more and more ""lazy"". So I'm turning to reddit, I want to know if anyone else has been at my age or has had similar situations as I'm going through, because I want that sort of reassurance to open up and to get the help I need, because my current plan is just to continue to suffer until I reach 18, and to then finally get help, but it already feels like I'm wasting so much time from not completing my tasks.

1m85olq,Worst “counsellor” experience of my life and I can’t stop thinking about it,"Today I had the most disturbing and invalidating experience I’ve ever had with a so-called mental health professional. My mum and I went to a counselling session through a service provided by her work (Converge International), hoping to get support for the way we miscommunicate sometimes and to try and break some unhelpful patterns between us. It already takes so much effort to be vulnerable, especially in front of a parent, and I was genuinely trying to open up.

But the counsellor, Lucia, was a nightmare from the start.

I explained the issue as calmly and openly as I could, and her response? She scoffed and asked, “Did you hear this in therapy? Is that why you’re saying you’re trying to be vulnerable?” Like… WHAT? Isn’t that exactly what I should be doing in therapy? It felt instantly dismissive and condescending. And it only got worse from there.

She kept going on about how “therapy isn’t always helpful” and how “some things are better left unsaid” and that “we don’t always need to talk about everything.” Then started talking about her own life and her son?? As if we were there to hear about her instead of the other way around. I actually had to hold back from saying, “I don’t give a fuck about your son, I’m literally here because I need help.”

At one point I clearly said, “I want to be able to talk about issues with my mum and resolve them,” and she just kept pushing this weird opinion that avoiding things is better. Like miss girl, that’s exactly what’s not working for us and why we’re here.

Then came the worst part: she started implying that maybe our communication problems were because my mum has a strong accent and that “things get lost in translation.” We don’t even speak English at home. She didn’t ask, didn’t check, just assumed. It was offensive, arrogant and ignorant. As if she already thought she had us figured out five minutes in.

I couldn’t even sit through the full session. I started crying and left after 30 minutes because I felt dumb for even seeing help. We were both so upset. We came in hoping to get help and left feeling judged, humiliated and honestly a little bit traumatised.

This wasn’t just a bad fit. This is someone who should not be practicing. If someone more vulnerable had walked in, especially someone already on the edge, I genuinely believe she could have pushed them OVER it.

I’m filing a formal complaint because what happened was beyond unacceptable, but I just needed to vent here because I’m still shaking with frustration and disbelief. How are people like this allowed to counsel anyone?

1m7tgoe,Why does it feel like people don’t genuinely support mental health?,"What I mean by this is that I feel like all the time I hear things like “I’m here for you” “it’s okay to not be okay” or this assumption that mental health is less stigmatized. However when symptoms are actually on display, even for something as well known as depression or anxiety, you’re suddenly overreacting and it isn’t okay? 

For example I’m not shy about the fact that I’m anxious and have an anxiety disorder, I let people know especially before when I first start jobs because I feel people deserve a heads up. When I tell people it’s always this supportive vibe, that it’s nothing to be ashamed of, that we’re here if you need anything, etc. but then when I’m having a random panic attack and need to step away for a moment to calm down I’m treated like I’m being irrational, that whatever I’m going through isn’t that big of a deal, or that I should just deal with it. 

It feels like people with mental health issues are only allowed to show surface level, easy to digest symptoms(if even that) but when the very real and difficult symptoms rears its head people do a 180 and low key treat you like a freak or that you’re, well, crazy. 

It’s like…yeah no shit, what did you expect?

And it makes it even harder when I’m struggling with other issues as well, especially ones not as well known/as common like DPDR or C-PTSD.

Idk, it just frustrates me a lot. Anyone else deal with stuff like this? What are your thoughts about it all?

1m89y06,My mental health is really bad at the moment and I just don't know what else to do anymore (depression and Agoraphobia/anxiety),"In March this year I had a massive mental breakdown. I'd been having minor panic attacks for weeks which to start with I actually thought were some kind of physical issue like a heart problem or POTS or something. At the end of February to celebrate my partners birthday we went away for the weekend and I had a massive panic attack while we were far away from home with no transport and no one to help us. Since that I haven't been able to go back to work. 

To start with, I couldn't even leave the house. I was on the verge of a panic attack constantly, I could barely get through the day. In the last few months I've gotten on antidepressants (Citalopram) and done some counselling and exposure therapy and I've started to tackle my Agoraphobia. Now I can go to the shop alone, go to the park alone, and go much further from home with my partner. 

But since February I haven’t left this town. And there's nothing here, 2 fairly mediocre cafes and 3 charity shops, that's *it*. There are a couple of nice walks which I enjoy when I can do them, but I haven't seen anything but the same place for 5 months. I spend a lot of time in the house because there's really not much for me/us to do outside and sometimes I'm still too scared to go far. 

A few weeks ago my partner lost his job due to chronic fatigue. So he's been home as well. To start with it was nice to be together, we're best friends and understand eachother very deeply and usually do everything together anyway. But now we're driving eachother crazy. My partner can be pretty neurotic about cleanliness and how things are done and I feel like I'm always walking on eggshells waiting for him to get upset with me or criticise me. He was emotionally abused by his father so I understand why he is the way he is, and he's getting therapy to try to work through it and be better, but it doesn't stop me from being 50% enraged and frustrated with him and 50% completely broken and tramped down. We bicker constantly and both treat eachother badly because we're both stressed, anxious and dealing with our own issues. I'm not a perfect partner so I know I'm as bad as he is. 

More than that though, the isolation is really getting to me. I'm so depressed at the moment. I've been down before but never like this. I dont feel anything besides misery and numbness. I dont reply to texts or messages, it feels too overwhelming- I can't handle talking to people. I dont know why. The other day I cried hysterically for about half an hour because I saw a stranger on Instagram just enjoying spending time with friends in the place they live and it made me so horribly sad and frustrated that I can't do that right now, that I can't go anywhere or do anything. I feel like an animal in a cage. 

I really am trying my best to get better, I stick to a strict daily routine, I take my medication every day, I did everything for my counselling and I try to do exposure therapy and go out by myself every day but it's taking so long to get better. I just want to be normal again. I want to love my partner again and have fun and go on nice days out. I want to see my parents and my friends. I want to leave this shithole town for a few hours at least. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel so sad and hopeless. I dont even know why this is happening  to me, I've always been so independent and confident and never had issues like this before. I just want to be normal again, I want to be happy again.

1m8fr48,"29F I feel invisible, unloved, and stuck. I just want a chance to live my life on my own terms."," I’m 29, a law graduate, and a single child. On the outside, I act like I enjoy being alone but the truth is, I’ve never wanted that. I’ve never really had someone to open up to or feel emotionally safe with.

Since childhood, I’ve been mocked for my childlike voice and for being fat. These things crushed my confidence early on. I developed deep insecurities, and over time, I began to believe I wasn’t worthy of love, friendship, or success. My voice, my body, my fear of speaking they all made me feel like I couldn’t belong.

I haven’t celebrated my birthday since 7th standard. Not because I didn’t want to but because no one seemed to care, and I stopped expecting it. My parents are present, but emotionally, I feel very distant from them. I can’t talk to them about how I feel they simply won’t understand. In their eyes, marriage is the goal, the measure of success. But I don’t want to be married just for the sake of it. I want to stand on my own feet first. I want to earn, to feel proud of myself, to have a say in my life.

I joined law school because of my parents’ advice, even though I had no courage to speak. But I ended up liking the subject I wanted to understand law, not just memorize it. After graduation, I tried practicing law, but the courtroom terrified me. I felt out of place, weak.

Then I started preparing for competitive exams. I tried seriously two times, even made it to the interview stage  but missed the final cutoff. And now, it feels like I’ve wasted my 20s: no job, no income, no peace. I started escaping into dramas and fantasy anything to forget how stuck I feel.

I’ve had dreams  of living alone, traveling solo, marrying someone I love, having a child one day. But now even studying feels impossible. I feel tired all the time. I overthink everything. Sometimes I think about hurting myself  I won’t lie but I haven’t done anything. I just don’t want to feel this hopeless anymore.I want to start my life again, but I’m scared. I feel like I have missed my chance. I see younger people already working, earning, or getting married, and I feel like I am left behind.  
I really want to rebuild myself  I want to earn, grow, and feel proud of who I am.

1m8625q,How do i communicate with my mom?,"I’ve been dealing with mental health issues for about 5–6 years now. I’m on medication and currently seeing both a psychiatrist and a psychologist

My mother knows about everything, but over the last few years my diagnosis has changed because I went through a depressive episode

I recently started seeing a new psychiatrist, who’s great and is still working on my diagnosis. The issue is that, in the meantime, my mom and I can barely communicate. We constantly misunderstand each other and it just causes more tension

The doctor told her that I have some neurodivergent traits and that I’m “different,” so basically we kind of “speak different languages.”

The hardest part is that I don’t feel guilt or empathy at all no matter the person or situation. I’ve literally never felt those emotions in my life. Now that my mom’s dad is seriously ill, she’s become even more sensitive, which makes it harder for her to deal with this side of me.

it just sucks, i’m anxious i’m going to die, but, for some reason my brain won’t focus on it, it’s like i can’t pay attention to my body or my brain right now, and it’s making me think it’s a ‘sense of impending doom’ or a ‘sense of knowing i’ll die’ rather than anxiety… i’m only 19, i don’t wanna die… i can feel my heart racing, but, otherwise i’m not really anxious… it kinda feels like what i feel like when i take my klonopin, like the thoughts are there, but, i can’t focus on them for more than a few seconds… the thing is, i haven’t taken my klonopin since like 9pm last night…

1m8eoox,I'm losing myself,"I'm 15 male and living in a family full of physical aggression, death threats, emotional abuse, social isolation and misanthropy.

I've never had real friends in my entire life(except for my Internet ex gf who's been through similar shit) and only recently started learning how to at least somewhat openly communicate on the Internet.

My mother terrorizes me a lot and whenever she does something for me, she immediately expects me to agree to what she just said and whatever the fuck.
If I don't to what she wants(not even necessarily in an asshole way) or ask her any questions that she deems as ""questioning her authority"" she becomes really upset.

Me and my 2 sisters, we're just like toys to a little child to her.
She feels super happy when she gives us ""care and love"" or whatever, but the moment we start doing anything she doesn't like and that's being humans and asking genuine questions, like what the fuck is going on here, she becomes really upset.

Like, literally starts crying like a baby and accuses me of random unrelated shit out of nowhere.
She's really entitled.

My father as well, he just has even more serious aggression problems and sometimes likes to tell us how he'd beat up and kill random strangers we see in public that did literally nothing.
They're obviously both really entitled, because they never admitted to any of this to anybody outside the family, let alone governmental institutions. That means they see themselves above the law.

Two days ago I started recording everything that's happening on my phone's microphone.
I've realized if I report them to the police, my parents might lie and my sisters might shut their mouths out of fear of getting beat up by my father to death.
I've caught some Jackpots the police would really be interested in though(murder threats, my mother's anger issues, etc).

But lately, Ive been starting to feel really weird.

Everything's the same as always, but now I'm starting to get extremely depressed.
Not the usual teenager Depressionen people always talk about where you're just lazy, but I actually feel literally nothing.
Fear and hate are the only things I can feel.

I thought I could push through this by brute force, but I guess after years of abuse, isolation, constant stress, gaslighting and emotional breakdowns I'm starting to finally fall apart entirely.

It feels like a fog has laid upon me.
I remember how I used to listen to music and feel happy, feel sad or excited, depending on the music.
Now it's just like a distant memory.
Sometimes I still cry a bit, or rarely, but it's getting less and less extremely fast and I don't know how to stop it.

This is real depression and I am going actually insane.
I'm planning on pushing through all the social anxiety that has built up and all the gaslighting and guilt tripping my parents do and go to the police.
In one or two weeks, after I have more evidence.

If I don't make it and lose my sanity in the process, I'm at least gonna know I tried.

1m8e17b,Connecting with your emotions in a healthier way,"It is easy to suppress emotions to avoid the difficult feelings that come with them and the actions required to improve them.

On the scale of uncontrollably feeling your emotions to neglecting them entirely, there is a healthy middle point that allows you to accept that life triggers all sorts of emotional responses but you can still maintain control of them in a healthy way.

Hopefully these questions help you gain some perspective and control to better manage difficult emotions

\------

* **“What do I call ‘calm’ that actually feels more like emptiness, detachment, or shutdown?”** *Action:* Rate your “calm” on a 1–10 aliveness scale. If it’s under 5, add a gentle sensory activity (music, warm drink, sunlight) to bring some feeling back online.
* **“When I say ‘I’m fine,’ what bodily signals contradict that statement?”** *Action:* Each time you say “fine,” pause to name one body cue (tight jaw, shallow breath, general fatigue) and take a regulating breath or stretch. Replace “fine” with a truer phrase in a private note.
* **“What activities or behaviours reliably help me not feel yet masquerade as healthy (e.g., over-exercising, over-working)?”** *Action:* Pick one “numbing-but-healthy-looking” habit and cap it for a day (e.g., a 30-minute workout instead of 90). Use the saved time for a feeling-focused practice like journaling or silent sitting.
* **“How do I define true peace, and how does that differ from the absence of sensation or emotion?”** *Action:* Write a personal definition of peace that includes presence and vitality. Create one simple “peace ritual” (slow tea, deep breathing) you can do daily to anchor it.
* **“When did numbness first become a successful strategy for survival or fitting in?”** *Action:* Acknowledge that strategy in writing (“Numbness helped me then”). Choose one safe person or space to share a small feeling now, as a step toward a new strategy.
* **What am I afraid my feelings might demand of me if I fully acknowledged it, and is that fear actually true, or inherited?** *Action:* List the top three “demands” you fear; next to each, note whether it’s fact, assumption, or family/cultural script—then pick one to gently test or disprove today.

I have a loan of around $3,000 to repay, and the monthly interest is becoming a serious burden. It’s from a leasing company, and they’re holding our house mortgage documents as security. That adds a lot of mental pressure on top of everything else.

What makes it even harder is that I’m the only one supporting my family. My parents are elderly and no longer working, and my younger sister is also dependent on me. I do my best every day to stay strong for them, but emotionally and financially, it's getting overwhelming.

My parents worked hard and sacrificed so much to pay for my university fees. I really want to make them proud and repay them in every way I can — but right now, I feel stuck because of this debt.

$3,000 might not sound like a lot to some, but for me — living in Asia — it's a big amount. I’m constantly learning and trying to keep my skills sharp, especially in cloud and DevOps areas.

I’ve always dreamed of pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science in Germany. I still believe in that dream, but with zero savings and this pressure on my shoulders, it feels like I’m stuck in survival mode with no clear path forward.

If you’ve ever been in a similar place — or if you just have some words of advice or encouragement — I’d truly appreciate hearing from you. I just need a little hope right now to keep pushing forward.

Thanks so much for reading. ❤️

1m8daw8,"Why am I SO angry all of the time? Genuinely pure rage, and it's not like me at all.","I used to be so chill. Just go with the flow for the most part and I only got upset about legitimate things. Over the last year or so I've just become increasingly angry and I cannot figure out what's up.

I had a pretty awful roommate, so I chalked it up to that, but now it's been 4ish months since we've separated and that excuse isn't working. 

My new baseline is so negative, and the smallest things send me over the edge. Someone asking a question, the bin not sliding nicely back under my bed, my dishes tip over as I load up the washer, my keys getting caught on the door handle, etc. 

Tiny issue = instant rage. Genuine rage. 

It hits and fades pretty quickly, just a few minutes, but then I just stay crabby. It's awful. I used to be such a happy go lucky person and just rolled with the punches and figured it out. Now it feels like I'm just giving up and I lost a part of myself. 

Any ideas? Helpful pointers? Literally anything?

If it matters: 29F, anxiety, depression, bulimia, and PTSD. I've had them all for over a decade so it's nothing new. Tried therapy but can't go anymore, lost insurance with my job.

everytime i talk about it people just tell me im still so young and i have so much time ahead of me, but that makes me even more upset. ive always been depressed but this is a new low. i just go through the motions. Ive done things that people say bring happiness back. I go to the gym three times a week. I hang out with friends, family, pets. I eat healthy. Im supposed to go to college this fall but i just hate it. I hate where i am, i hate who i am, i hate how i look. I hate that i will have to work a job for the rest of my life, probably struggle to pay bills, and bide time until i become old and unable to do anything i want. I used to go to therapy and i was on anti depressants for a long time, but they just made me feel numb and i could never truly open up at therapy, even when i switched therapists. 

Mostly what seems to spark this as of late is not being able to go to college and play sports for the school. I would do anything to be able to do that, but i didnt find my love of sports until recently. I dont really care about rec leagues or anything. I just wish i could play for an actual college. I could have done that with soccer. I had a few colleges looking to recruit me, but i didnt enjoy soccer as much as i do basketball now. But its all just too much too late.

1m8clye,Trying to help my brother with continuing issues...,"Hi all, I live with chronic illness (fibromyalgia, sleep apnea) and mental health issues (CPTSD; to some degree all of my family does, too. My brother (23) has been experiencing escalating mental heath and physical health symptoms since 2020. He's become more and more reclusive and debilitated by his symptoms. They've all only been treated as mental health symptoms so far and the physical haven't really been explored. He experiences extreme fatigue and sometimes can't even manage to stay awake for more than 10 minutes after being woken up if he's tired. He's missing work, doctors appointments, can't reliably keep plans/socialize, and is barely functional. His therapist, who he's been very consistent with, apparently has been begging him for months to go to some higher level of care like an IOP or PHP. I suspect there's a physical component at this point. He's very skinny, and has said in the past he struggles to stay above 100lbs for long periods of time (he's about 5'8?) because he has a hard time (1) remembering to eat, (2) eating enough, (3) and he's always had a fast metabolism. My grandmother has graves disease and I'm starting to wonder if that's the case for him; he's the only one in our immediate family that's skinny like he is.

He's very difficult to convince to do things. He went on leave from work for MH reasons earlier in the year and was able to get better for a short period of time, but after returning to work he's slowly slid back into being ill.

Any hunches on what might be going on? Advice on talking to him or what steps to take?

1m8cl3m,"I don't know how to help my man with ""growing some balls"" (if I can even say that) or just having some ""courage"" or whatever to stand up for himself and do things to help himself in situations","I've (27yrs) been with my man (29yrs) for a year now and since I met him I knew he was a gentle man that is very accepting and loving. I love him a lot because of these traits , I think he is perfect but in this world you need to be about to say ""fuck off"" or ""no"" to anyone if it means peace of mind and your own safety. A lot of people would class his behaviours as being a doormat , with how he allows certain people to treat him with disrespect or even how he allows certain people to take advantage of him. From day one I've always tried to just let him know that he shouldn't accept certain ways people speak to him or shouldn't let people tell him to do certain things he might not fully be comfortable with and that it's ok to say ""no"" but obviously he is his own person and will do his own thing , as much as I know it won't be good for him. He has surrounded himself with manipulators (in my opinion) who clearly do not care about him but for some reason he still wants to ""help them out"" or do favours for them even though they've honestly treated him like actual shit! When I point out their behaviour towards him is disgusting he'll agree but reluctantly , and then he'll talk about how they've known eachother for years and they've been on holidays and he knows their kids etc etc. Recently he has done a favour for one of these manipulators (despite him knowing that the consequences of this favour going south would be danger to his safety and owing the guy a lot of money) which has now bit him in the ass and now he owes this guy a lot of money (even though it technically it has nothing to do with him - he's basically been used as a skapegoat). He does recognise that he made a poor choice by doing this favour for this guy he calls his ""friend"" and that he'll never do it again , but it just bothers me that even though he knows it's not his problem or his fault , he still goes about justifying the problem for this guy and still texts the guy with respect even though this guy has clearly f*cked him over. So my problem or my concern is how do I help him with just getting better at standing up for himself and really recognising that these people (or any future people that come into his life) are people you need to cut out of your life for good even if you've shared ""good"" times with them? How do I help him with just , I don't know , respecting? Himself more? Or just maybe loving himself enough to not associate with shitty people? I'm not sure if the issue is him not loving himself or not respecting himself but I can't help but think that that is the issue. 

*Giving some background on my man ; he has had a father (passed away when he was 20) that was very... I don't know , cut throat in a way , and I would say he definitely was emotionally and mentally neglected a lot growing up , he was also very badly bullied a lot (got jumped etc) in secondary school for no reason , so I feel like these things have definitely shaped the way he's viewed himself but I'm not a professional psychologist so I wouldn't know how deeply these things can affect a man*",1,8,1753382463.0,mentalhealth,Munchies12345,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8cl3m/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_man_with_growing_some/,2025-07-25T09:58:13.312378
1m8ch3n,No interest in activities,"Just curious here because I feel that my life may be boring from the outside perspective. 
I’ve struggled with mental health most of my adult life but finally got to a good place mentally and financially as well as quitting alcohol and the devils lettuce. And have been consistently for roughly 9 months now I would say. 
However outside activities don’t interest me. Going to bars with friends, hanging out so they can sit on their phones and smoke weed without actually interacting. I just don’t feel it’s a fair trade off to go out and do things that don’t interest me or give any productive results. Spending money that I don’t need to. I’m perfectly content sitting at home with my cat for 70% of my time or fishing, just sitting at the beach and enjoying nature. It’s not that I don’t have motivation I feel I just over analyze every aspect of the activity and most of the time my expectations are correct in how it goes.

1m8bft7,Unhealed wounds resurface,"I had this friend a couple of years ago that I got really close to and expressed my childhood traumas to (parental domestic violence, substance abuse). We would exchange memes, videos of being important to each other. I have a very difficult time being vulnerable and trusting of people, so this connection was very important to me. Well, they got back together with their ex toxic partner with history of infidelity and physical assault. They ended up getting pregnant several months after getting back together. This ex partner was not fond of our closeness and basically put a wedge between my friend and I. There was a couple of times where this friend and I would talk through issues and it would end up the same way of their partner being upset that we are speaking. I decided that I cannot do the back and forth of making up and breaking up with this friend.

Still, to this day, I have found myself checking this friend and their partner’s social medias several times a day. I also consult the internet on the stages of toxic relationships and evaluation of their social media behaviors to ensure their relationship satisfaction is low and the possibility of them breaking up soon. This brings me feelings and shame and feeling like a weirdo.

While doing introspective work, I realize that this fixation tends to happen with those who resemble my parent or family dynamics. I am doing my best to reign in on the compulsions and urges but it is hard to envision that I have to do this for the rest of my life. I just feel alone and an outsider.

1m8beel,Tips on how to be more active and present in life.,"I want this to be a general thread of tips that people have used to basically improve their quality of life.

My story is that I went through several years of messed up situations and it has messed me up to the point of not being able to handle stress, especially work stress. I was diagnosed with several different mental health disorders throughout my teens and twenties basically. I end up having to quit to stay home so now I'm a stay-at-home parent. Having a child did improve my life by having something to live for, but I don't recommend having kids if you don't feel like you're ready so that's not the advice. After being overly medicated and stuck at home, I did a lot of realizing and that my problems weren't medication related and it honestly made me feel worse in the end. I mostly needed therapy.

So I lost part of myself over a few years where I would just be a void of a human basically and didn't do much besides the basics of taking care of my child while everyone else picked up the other slack. I felt bad about it. So one day instead of sitting around feeling bad about it like doing work around the house and keeping a basic routine. I actually feel a lot better than I did. It was pretty hard at first, but I managed to make a routine and do stuff. I still have days where I feel lazy and slack off but only for a couple of days.

*I guess my piece of advice is to just do a little at a time each day and build off of that slowly but surely. You won't see a change overnight. I went from doing almost nothing to doing most of the housework on top of caring for a toddler.

-A negative habit I have now is spending hours watching random interesting videos on YouTube. I'm trying to limit that because it makes me exhausted after awhile. It's weird.

But I didn’t quite understand the effects of that trauma and growing up in a very dysfunctional family until I graduated high school. Things were still bearable since I thought I had plenty of time to figure stuff out, but things started to go south after I moved away for college (what I’d call very poor decision-making on my end because I didn’t know any better and was mostly clueless). It was a bad place with terrible living conditions and was pretty much never able to fit in. (pls bear in mind I'm not from a First World country.)

Fast forward to today, I hold a master’s degree, but I am still clueless, lost, and miserable. Unemployed, and it was very difficult for me to finish my studies, not because I was failing but because I took too many drops during my bachelor’s and then also before getting into a master’s program. Mainly because I get scared and freeze when faced with unpredictability and challenge followed by losing the will to do anything because I feel like a failure. I feel like my life is this endless pattern of misery, feeling stuck, and lack of will.

Below I'm writing down everything that I struggle with, hoping that some of you would be kind enough to help me make sense of it. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, I'm just trying to understand what it could be and some help in managing these issues:

 

·         **Inability to maintain any relationship** whatsoever, especially friendships. It pains me so much yet it keeps happening over and over again.

·         Not being able to get over the fact that **im ugly as fuck** and im not being delusional. I really am not pretty. Instagram is really triggering because I'm **constantly comparing** myself with other girls, and I don’t mean supermodels or heavily edited pictures, just normal women with beautiful, feminine features like big eyes, small chin and overall facial harmony. I have facial asymmetry and unpleasant facial features like bigger teeth, small eyes. (despise what I see in the mirror and pictures; keep taking pictures to figure what I actually look like)

·         **No willingness, anxiety, or drive** whatsoever to **study**. Even when I had exams, I couldn’t care less. I tried to study but my mind kept wandering off and because I don’t have a habit of studying, I couldn’t get myself to do it the night before the exams either and it has been like that since getting out of high school. **(continued in comments...)**

If it’s possible for you, please help me make sense of my situation. I’d be really grateful.",1,6,1753377902.0,mentalhealth,Aprilismybirthmonth,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m8aki3/please_take_a_moment_to_read_this_post_i_need_help/,2025-07-25T09:58:13.312378
1m8aj8t,masochist?,"I find it strange that there is part of my mind that likes to be tortured. I like hurting my self emotionally/mentally and a little health wise. 

Like dealing with a break up everyone told me to move on and do no contact for a long time, don’t talk to her or meet up- well we talked on the phone a few days ago and met up. And after I was so depressed/anxious and a million other things, knowing well I should not, and also people in my circle would yell at me saying don’t do it.

I like to walk the streets of NyC for hours on end and sometimes I don’t stop and drink or eat till my body really needs it. Or knowing I should maybe get a taxi back to the place I am staying. Also with NyC I been inches of getting run over by a car/bike and not care. 

Working in the workshop on my art, with little water, for a few mins under and hour or around an hour or so. I do have water with me and it’s not far to the house. Idk

I have also been dealing with depression for my whole life (30) and I attempted my first time last year, but have always thought of ways of trying to end it and there’s part of me that thinks I will try agin and also I don’t care if I die tomorrow. But at the same time I am scared to attempt agin and also I know I am young and have so many ideas and stuff I want to do. 

I am neurodivergent maybe that has something to do with it. I did try cutting my self years ago but to scared to do anything besides a small cut.

1m7t4zx,I Hate myself and I dont know what to do.,"I'm 26. I have adhd, clinical anxiety and depression. My parents are divorced and I had a very rough childhood. I am venting and also asking for help. This is me.

I was bullied in 2nd through 7th grade. Physical, mental, emotional you name it. 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade It was basic,like. Fat ugly stupid. 5th grade I got in a few fights but it wasnt crazy. 6th grade was hell. I had a bully named Taten. He would constantly torment me physically and when I would act out in self defense he would make himself the victim. Luring me into situations that made me look bad. He made the entire 6th grade think I am a killer cause I pushed him after he kneed me up the butt 5 times and he fell and faked a seizure. I know he faked it because he smiled and tried to make me work with him on the way to the principals office. 7th was the worst, taken was gone but on the bus a new bully was even more cruel. He would sweet talk and we wolluld be friendly for a day or two then .he would say the most vile things. He would kick me and spit on me. He would say every worse thing and I gave him the reaction he wanted. The bus driver didnt care, my mom called the bus depo and school but that made it worse. I eventually learned to ignore him, but by doing so it became worse. After that I became a ghost, siting at the back of class and not having many friends.

While being bullied I finally was diagnosed with adhd at 12 which help with me failing school. My step dad didn't (still really doesn't) like me. My biggest issue with adhd is my memory. He would ask me to clean the bathroom, I'd forget and he would just sigh in disappointment and shake his head. He hated when I played video games too. When I would go to my dad's house on the weekends it was worse. My step mom didn't like me for a long time because of something I said when I was 4. I dont even remember what it was but it stuck with her. (She is the mistress) my dad hated my adhd jitteryness and he called it annoying ""john"" (fake name, names not John). He would say hey your being annoying ""john"" go take your meds so we can have good ""john"". Every when I went, if I tried to be me I felt like I was hated. My mom, maternal grandparents, and my sister on my mom's side are the only people I feel comfortable around.

Those paragraphs are giving a glimpse into my life. Those experience I feel like so deeply engraved in my mind that I'm horrible. I can never get anything right and I screw everything up. I HATE MYSELF! My life has fallen apart and I desperately want to get better and get my life back on track but I hate myself. Why try to help a worthless thing like me? It's feels impossible so why try? I'm only here for my mom and sister. So I'm asking how to I get out of this hell? This feeling of complete and under failure in my bones. How do I love myself?

1m88tm2,"Help for Trauma, ADHD, depression & anxiety","I’m posting this in case someone’s able to point me the correct direction or knows any resources.

For some context, I’m currently a student based in the UK. I’m diagnosed with ADHD, severe depression and anxiety. I experienced years of emotional abuse and neglect throughout childhood and I (unknowingly at the time) used dissociation as a coping mechanism. I normally manage to get by but even when I have a good spell, my conditions affect my day to day life quite heavily, I’m currently going through a bad spell and it’s heavily affected my work and studies. I have been going to GPs for years but they offer little help, they’ve mainly offered antidepressants which had little affect on me and low intensity cbt which I have been discharged from twice, as my condition was too severe. Recently I’ve been put on a waiting list for high intensity CBT, I’ve been to my uni’s counselling service and also can’t help due to the severity of my condition. I am currently on elvanse which has helped with day to day life but I’m still very heavily inhibited, especially when going through a bad spell.

I have no means to pay for private therapy. So if anyone knows of any info/advice or can point towards a direction, it would appreciated. Oh and also I have spoken to my gp recently and they suggested trying Mirtazapine, but apprehensive to go on it.

1m88j0m,Childhood fantasies of getting hurt turned sexual,"This is something I’ve never talked about with anyone, but I’m curious to know if others have had similar experiences or thoughts.

Ever since I was a kid—like 8 or 9 years old—when I would lay in bed to sleep, I’d start imagining these strange, detailed scenarios. One recurring fantasy was that I was lying on a conveyor belt in a factory, always on my stomach, and at each “station” someone would hurt my back in a different way—cutting, burning, that kind of thing. It wasn’t about fear or danger; it felt oddly… comforting? I wasn’t resisting, just existing in it.

Later, my fantasies started evolving into more heroic ones—like taking the hit for someone else, jumping in front of an attack or a blast from an imaginary villain. And something that always stood out: I wasn’t always myself. Sometimes I was characters from shows, and in many of the fantasies, I was a boy—even though I’m not trans, have never questioned my gender, and don’t really have any strong feelings about it. It just felt normal in the dream/fantasy space.

As I got older, these scenarios turned sexual. A lot of masochistic elements came into play—being used for someone else’s pleasure, being hurt in that context. The confusing part is, I wasn’t exposed to porn until I was 14, and I didn’t even know what sex was before that. So it feels like these fantasies just… developed naturally, from inside me?

Now I’m 19, and I think this has impacted me in ways I don’t fully understand. I think I might be a sex addict, honestly. I’ve never had sex—partly because I’m scared I won’t enjoy “normal” sex unless there’s pain involved. But I also can’t fall asleep without masturbating. At this point, it’s basically muscle memory. It feels like it’s the only way I can quiet my brain and rest, but it also feels compulsive.

I’m not really looking for a diagnosis, but I do want to understand if this kind of thing is common. Has anyone else had deep, recurring fantasies from a young age that shaped their adult sexuality in this way? Is it something people grow out of, or learn to manage? I’d just love to know I’m not alone in this.",0,4,1753373315.0,mentalhealth,kayda_fuyumi,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m88j0m/childhood_fantasies_of_getting_hurt_turned_sexual/,2025-07-25T09:58:13.312378
1m88hk7,i am so tired of teens using cluster b disorders as reasons to be a jerk,"i know this seems ironic because i am a teen with a medically recognized cluster b disorder, but im genuinely so tired of it. specifically, around 7 different psychiatrists have told me i almost definitely have bpd but im not yet 18 so i cant get fully diagnosed. 

it sucks. i hate living like this and the guilt i carry for the shitty things i’ve done is crushing. but if i see one more 15 year old self diagnose bpd, or bipolar, or whatever else and then say something like :

“people when a mentally ill person does mentally ill things” or “idk why you’re upset that i hurt you when im mentally ill” (things i’ve actually seen both irl and online)

im going to lose my shit. it’s not even just that they’re actively hurting others—which is a major part of it because pretending that [insert disorder] suddenly absolves you of all wrongdoing is insane. thinking that a reason for something is suddenly going to make what you did less awful as if the impact of your actions is somehow reduced is absurd to me. 

it’s that people who do this genuinely make it harder for people who are actually trying to get better to live and function. if you spend your time convincing everyone you know that people with your disorder are bad people and that everyone else just has to deal with it, it doesn’t just affect you. 

i see people get upset about the stigma around cluster b disorders constantly and then they go on to do stuff like this and all i can think is “you’re the problem. you’re part of the reason this happens”

i have spent my entire life trying to get better and do better as a person. i’ve been in and out of therapy since i was 3 years old. i’ve spent the past 2 years constantly, every week, sometimes twice a week, sometimes every weekday, in therapy or some form of mental health treatment working on myself and trying to do better. 

people who use the mentally ill excuse completely erase any progress that can be made for a community that’s already so heavily hated. i feel like for every person trying to genuinely get better there’s 10 more just using whatever disorder they can come up with to be a shit person

and i know that this in itself is probably some other mental issue. and that’s the worst part i think. those people who really just enjoy not having consequences for their actions will always have an out and maybe i’m immature but that makes me so mad. i’m so tired of it.

1m87x9b,Post travel depression and anxiety,"I recently travelled for the second time this summer, about 1-2 months apart. Before this, I hadn’t travelled since I was a kid. On the both trips, I reunited with friends and family. I came back from the second trip a few days ago. After the trips I have come back home feeling extremely depressed and empty. I don’t feel like doing things and I hate the things and people around me. I have a feeling of anxiety and fear, and some jealousy. I get mild to medium anxiety attacks during the day.

I’ve come to learn that it’s not really about the place, but more about the people that I’ve gotten attached to and have to leave behind in those places. Is this some sort of seperation anxiety? I hate the thought of visiting these people a few times a year rather than being able to live near them.

I live in a country that probably has a better or equal outlook and quality of life to the countries I visited and I live with my immediate family here. The feeling is destroying me inside. I have tried going out and talking to friends but it only helped a little. I feel like I just wanna book a flight right now and just go there.

Please tell me what I’m going through and what I can do to overcome this. Everytime I look back at photos it makes me tear up.

1m828bs,I thought I was just tired. But no amount of sleep was fixing it.,"I used to think I was just weak.
I’d wake up and feel like I already lost the day. I had zero energy, but all the guilt in the world.
People would say, “Just go for a walk.”
Or “Try being more grateful.”
Cool. Thanks. That walk didn’t fix the fact that I couldn’t feel anything.

I wasn’t lazy. I wasn’t ungrateful.
I was drowning, quietly. Showing up to work. Smiling. Nodding. Scrolling. But inside? I felt like a ghost.
And the worst part? No one could tell.
Even I couldn’t tell — not clearly — until I realized this wasn’t normal exhaustion.
It was depression.

There’s so much content out there — but most of it feels fake, shallow, or written by someone who’s never actually felt it.

However, recently i've been having anxiety attacks non stop in, stronger then ever before about my future. I'm scared for lots of reassons, 1 of them is being scared i could never be happy and that those waves of emotions will continue forever.
The second one is not being able to open up to another, i'm scared that i'll get in a relationship while still not being able to cry and say anything up in my mind to her and be real with her and myself.
My 3rd fear is the biggest one of them (the one who drove me crazy all summer non stop).
It's fearing i won't find a future wife, it sound silly but there are leyers to it, i'm mostly scared i won't find a woman i'd want to marry.
Now for my reasson (is the main purpose of this post).
The **only** thing i really think of in life is a happy marriage and it's all i want in life. However, recently i've been informed of someone i know losing his virginity (i won't get into details, but he's younger then 15).
And it raised something in my mind that i haven't thought of in a while.

I don't want my future wife to have slept with anyone but me.

And with the way the internet is and with that ""someone"" i know.

I'm affraid that the number of women that would wait to have until they find a suitable parter which they can see a future with is decreasing.

And all summer i have been deppressed to the point i can't handle anymore (that suicidal thoughts came back) and i have been struggling to figure out if i'm the only guy who cares about it and if there is any hope...

1m87bet,What to do about one-sided friend groups?,"I've been a part of a friendship group for over 4 years at this point. We've enjoyed our time together greatly and used to get together almost every week. Last year was a tough year for all of us and one of our friends got a different job where our schedules didn't line up. We never figured out a new date or time and suddenly things started to drift apart. One of my friends got diagnosed with depression as well. This year we've only gotten together a couple of times, mostly meeting up with each other individually on occasion. 

I've taken this drift apart really hard, I don't have other friends like the other people in this group. They are my only friends and I didn't make an effort to seek new ones since they mean so much to me. My one friend actually quit her job that had caused the scheduling issues but hasn't put forth any effort to get us together. She seems to be living her life to the fullest without any of us. Other friends say nothing and don't even try to get us all together. I'm almost always the person to suggest things to others. I haven't even made much of an effort this year to make plans, wanting others to do it but they don't. I've actually been busy with moving my brother in, finding a new job and family emergency things. When I talk to these friends it seems like they're doing the normal stuff like jobs, life, etc. but still no effort is put forward. 

No one seems to want to step up. No one checks in on me except one friend who seems to actually care. No one else does though. They're off in their own worlds, living life while I worry myself half to death if they're okay or if they even like me or if this group is just done for. 

I'm starting to think I should just give up and let it go. Meet up on occasion until someone puts in some effort. Make new friends or something. It's been eating me from the inside out all year and any advice would be great.

I started out by trying a lot of supplements for anxiety (my mom is really into natural stuff). After that I went on ssris. citalopram, zoloft. That was through a primary care doctor. Then I went to a psychiatrist. I tried a few more ssris. I tried clomipramine. I tried glutamate modulators. I tried an antipsychotic along with an ssri. I went through ketamine treatment along side therapy. I have gone to an outpatient ERP program. They couldn't treat my severe anxiety and sent me to a DBT program which turned out to be the worst therapy experience of my life. I have been to countless therapists and psychiatrists. I have tried kratom, cbd, kanna, NAC, St Johns wort. Any ""natural"" supplement you can name I have tried. I have done trauma and somatic therapy. Brainspotting, yoga, interoception, mindfulness, body scanning, deep breathing, meditation. I've even done multiple psychedelics. My psychiatrist (who I have gone to for years) prescribed me clonazepam. Not even the benzo did anything for my anxiety.

I have heavily abused alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, DXM, Ketamine. Anything to quiet the anxiety. But it has destroyed my health.

To be clear the mental illness was present before abusing these substances. That is why I turned to these substances.

I have been looking into things like Stellate Ganglion Block, TMS (this doesn't seem promising for a number of reasons), vagus nerve stimulation.

My mother is an emotional lady since her childhood and comes from a non toxic and a very healthy family. 
But My dad is a narcissist who was the worst husband to my mother since day 1 and her in laws were equally horrible. The stories of mental torture are horrible… 
It is a failed marriage basically. 

The thing is, my mom does not drain all of her trauma on us on a daily basis but since my mother and dad fight almost daily, she breaks down being angry and sad and then the drama unfolds. 
She cries and narrates all the horrible incidents of my dad and his parents.

I resent my father but he will never change. Our home is toxic because of him. 

But I cannot bear to listen to all the horrific things which happened with my mum and I don’t know how to handle all the trauma and I feel helpless, stressed and anxious always. 
It is those same stories again and again…

I am now married to a guy who is the greenest flag ever but I struggle to maintain a healthy relationship with him due to fear of similar things happening to me which my mom faced. I have become the toxic one in my marriage. 
While being away from mum I always worry about her mental health. 

I’m sure if I tell my mother about all of this, she will most definitely try her best to not do this again. She tries her best to give us a good life and protect us from a narc dad but she will be very hurt and might feel lonely. I don’t want that. Because if her children wont empathise with her and listen to her feelings then who will? Maybe only speaking about her traumatic past can give her closure?

Its the best job ive ever had but the bar is not high at all compared to straight up being called replaceable.   The benefits are fantastic and ive been given esop, 401k. And up to 5 bonus checks at once.     The people cant be trusted.  They are all snakes and the worksite is full of cliques and drama and it's hard to believe some of them are 50+     

The orders I need to prepare for are often lengthy. And have a ton of steps.  Pallets.  Boxes.  Pieces.    The gates are stacked on poles in the yard. Which I pull with a crane attachment.  I then stage them with their materials so I can put it all on a truck.  This process can take up to two hours because some gates are buried behind 30 others

My dispatcher puts the orders on the schedule.  Prints a bill of lading.  And I track down said materials.     The etiquette is to do this a day before because the delivery trucks can show up first thing in the morning.   

Its a two person job and my partner just quit


For the last few weeks since.  My dispatcher left the schedule empty for the entire day.  Waited till I went home.  Then loaded up the schedule with bulky orders.

I told my team leader this needs to be addressed because I cant keep up with it if they dont give me time to prepare the orders.

1m85uk8,Am I losing it ?,"Lately, every day feels heavy and pointless. Nothing brings me joy, pride, or peace. I feel like I’m stuck in someone else’s life—a film I’ll wake up from—but I don’t even remember what the “real me” felt like.

Time with loved ones only reminds me how disconnected I am—from life, people, emotions. I don’t laugh, I don’t feel things the way I used to. I question my intelligence, my empathy, my ability to grow.

I convinced myself that I’m just not that smart, and that all of this is a result of that. But there’s a quiet voice in my head telling me that my current state is what’s blocking all of that. And now that just confuses me more—how can someone want to be better, want to achieve certain things, and then a block like this makes it even worse than before? I don’t understand what the world is, what life is, or what the point of ANYTHING is.

I don’t think I’ve ever really thought about the meaning of life before—and why would I? Things used to be fine. I’m grateful for the life I have now—I have a roof over my head, a healthy family, friends who are doing okay. I am grateful, but I don’t feel it. Honestly, I think I’m just spoiled. Very spoiled. And I expect things to just happen on their own. They used to, for the most part—but those were small things. Now I expect that one day I’ll magically wake up and just know what I want from life, what kind of person I should be. That I’ll be happy, kind to everyone, talkative, and interesting.

I used to expect life to just unfold, and now I realize I have no real direction. I don’t know how to connect with people, form opinions, or even be curious about the world. I don’t even find anyone attractive and all this worries me.I’m surrounded by kind people, yet I feel numb. I fake smiles, say barley ANYTHING, only thing I can talk about is how lost I am.


How can I fit into a society of young people full of ambition, knowledge, culture, wit, and fun?
How am I supposed to have interesting conversations with them? Maybe I could—if I had the knowledge and confidence to express my opinion. But that’s the problem: I don’t have my own opinion. I don’t think. I don’t even allow myself to form one on different situations or events… and even when I do, it’s usually very basic.

I want to be someone joyful, curious, connected. But I expect to become that person without doing the work. I avoid opportunities, I fear being seen, I retreat. I wonder if I was meant to be this way—lost, unsure, emotionally behind.

I can’t find a reason to try to be better. I don’t remember what it feels like to be relaxed or at peace. The only reason I’m still here is because of my family—because it wouldn’t be fair to them if I killed myself. But it’s not fair to them that I’m like this, either. If I were gone, they’d be sad for a while, but they’d get over it. Maybe they’d even understand that it would be easier for me.

I won’t kill myself—I can handle pain for a long time. But what a waste of life, being stuck like this. I don’t know how to help myself. What does “getting better” even mean? I don’t feel like myself. I don’t even know who I am—maybe no one does, because I’ve never shown my real self.

I know thoughts shape reality, and that change is possible. But what do you do when you realize you’re behind in emotional, intellectual, and social development?
I actually still believe I will wake one day and be done with this shit but it will be in a way that I went crazy

1m85eub,Everything Keeps Going Wrong and I Don’t Know Why I Keep Messing Up,"I don’t even know where to begin, but the past two weeks have been a cascade of things going wrong, and I just feel like it’s all my fault — even though I don’t understand how I keep screwing everything up when I do care. I really do.

It all started when my sister and I began our road-trip to move me in to Utah and on that car ride I felt deathly ill, so I couldn’t do anything in Utah and had to go to urgent care, found out I had an STD and also a separate bacterial infection that almost turned into sepsis. I was so ill and spent the whole time laying in bed and I felt so bad because my sister was there. 

The next day we left for a long roadtrip to Montana and Canada and the day we got to Montana I realized I forgot my passport, probably because I was so preoccupied with being sick and could barely move. I figured it out and got my friend to ship it to me, thankfully, but it came a day late so we missed a day of Canada trip. I chose the wrong shipping carrier even though I had a gut feeling not to, but got convinced to choose the one that ended up being late. I was obsessing over it for days because I made the wrong decision. Not to mention at the festival we went to in Montana I lost my 150$ glasses.

I was on antibiotics for my infection, but I misread the instructions and was underdosing for several days. Now I’m paranoid that I didn’t heal properly and that I made everything worse by not being careful enough.

On my way into Canada, I didn’t adjust my mph to km/hr, and got pulled over almost immediately for speeding. Another dumb mistake that I feel so stupid for. 

And lastly, we are camping in Canada, and today I hit a small stump that was on the way out of our campsite. My car is brand new. There’s damage to the bumper and something is rubbing against the tire. I feel sick about it. I’m in another country and supposed to drive back in two days. I don’t even know if the car is safe to drive. I just keep thinking:  how am I this careless? 

I care about things. Deeply actually. I overthink, I try to make the right decisions, I try to take responsibility, but somehow everything still turns into a mess. I hate this feeling. I hate that I keep disappointing myself. I hate that everyone around me probably thinks I am just a mess. I hate how indecisive and anxious I am, and how much space these “mistakes” take up in my mind.

I feel like I’m not built for this life. I try so hard to be good, to do things right, and it still blows up in my face. I’m starting to feel like maybe I am just broken in some way.

I don’t know what I want from this post. Maybe just to not feel so alone in this spiral.

I flew to him last week and went to a concert with him (not my style of music) because he was having a rough week. He then proceeded to tell me he didn't enjoy it because I was there.

I suffer with anxiety, not majorly but enough and I often feel like I don't really belong anywhere and I dont mean much to those around me. Usually I can tell myself that its my anxiety and I'm being silly but Yesterday showed me I'm not being silly at all.

1m84ox7,She (F24) left my(M26) life but is invading my dreams,"A few days ago, I posted on here about something that’s been sitting heavy on me. I thought writing it out would help clear my head—and maybe for a moment, it did. But now it’s gotten worse.

She’s in my dreams. Every single night.

Sometimes I’m sprinting through the streets of Italy trying to find her. Other nights, my phone is ringing—her name glowing on the screen—and I’m straining with everything I’ve got to answer. But I can’t move. I’m frozen. Stuck in sleep paralysis. Fighting just to lift my arm. And when I finally snap awake… my shoulder hurts. Like I was actually battling sleep to reach her. Like I strained to answer a call that never even happened.

Sometimes I hear her voice. Other times, it’s someone else. A new guy. Or I run into this mystery dude in my dreams, and I just know he’s with her now. That one shattered me.

What scares me most is that I’ve never had anything like this happen before. I’ve been through hard endings, but no one’s ever followed me into my sleep like this. It’s like she’s taken over the one place I used to escape everything.

I can hold it together during the day, mostly. But then something small—some random smell, or a song on the radio—flips the switch. And suddenly, it’s all back. Loud and sharp and overwhelming.

I used to think sleep was where I’d finally get some peace. Now it’s where she lives.

Since all this started, I can barely get out of bed. I’m forcing myself to show up to work. I’m barely eating—maybe one meal a day if that. I’ve already lost ten pounds in the past week or two. I’ve got my first therapy appointment scheduled… but it’s not until the 8th. And honestly, I don’t know how I’m gonna make it that long without crashing out again like I did in my last post.

The only thing that’s helped even a little is not seeing her at work these past few days. But even then, it’s like she’s still there—just showing up in different ways.

I’m not looking for advice. I’m just wondering if anyone else has ever been haunted like this. If anyone’s ever had someone live in their head this deep, even when they’re unconscious.

1m7zu4y,"New Precision Approach for Treating Depression: More Personalized, Less Trial and Error","There’s some exciting news coming from the University of Arizona! They’re working on a new, personalized approach to treat depression that’s more effective and tailored to each person’s unique needs.

Instead of relying on the usual “trial and error” method, where patients go through different medications or therapies until something works, this new method uses **Artificial Intelligence technology** and **personal data** (like your genes, lifestyle, and mental health history). The goal is to find the right treatment for each individual faster and more accurately.

This could be a huge improvement for people struggling with depression, as it aims to make care more personalized and effective right from the start.

It’s still in development, but this could be a big step toward better, more targeted mental health care.

With everything we shared for over a decade, I know you. I know you more than I know myself. And I want to give you the world. My world. Because my world has become yours. But the problem now is, I know you too well. And you don’t know how that feels. You never had a family who knows you to the core. Who accepts you for who you are. But I saw you from the beginning. And I love every part. 
I know when you’re trying to hide the truth because you learned it from home, that hiding the truth came with less punishment. But in this type of love, it doesn’t work the same. I need to love both the good and bad. And when I seem angry and unlovable, it’s because my love feels meaningless. When we met we chose to become life partners, life witnesses, a forever, where we would never leave without the fight. But I’m loosing you… Im loosing you to your own demons. I’m loosing you because you don’t trust me enough to wanna work it through. I don’t care what has happened, I don’t care how bad it is, when it was, but I need to know it all, to give my all.

Let me live every part of you. I’m not scared of getting hurt. I’m scared you’re too afraid to hurt me. But I’m strong. I’m not your family. And I’m not the average woman. I’m weird. I can be scary. And I can definitely be wrong. But please don’t give up on me. Please give me the chance. I promise it’s better than the alternative. I hope I get the chance. And maybe you’ll se this, maybe you won’t. But if you do, I love you, let me be your rock. I know you are longing for exactly that, but I don’t know if you will ever believe that I want to. But please try to believe, and even if you don’t, take the chance. I promise that it can’t get worse, if you already are considering leaving.

1m83eny,Extinguishing my last ray of hope,"Hey. My life is an absolute hell in every metric, and it's been like that for my entire existence pretty much.

Recently I had a misfortune of injuring my back that left me in chronic pain. I managed to heal through hard and extensive work. As a profilactic measure I agreed to some innovative procedure. I made the choice traumatized by the pain I experienced, while trying to prevent it from coming back.

Now months after the surgery I'm in more pain then ever, barely being able to walk. The surgeon who did it and recommended it doesn't care. I went to see a different specialist who said I shouldn't have done it.

I've been in a suicidal state for years before. Now I'm barely hanging on. I'm in massive pain, knowing I caused it. I freaking knew not to do it but I was so indifferent and depressed that I went along. I did so much to get better and I erased it forever. 

Now I'm in massive pain where every movement reminds me how much of a fuck up I am. I'm broke and alone. My OCD is going crazy over having some foreign substance in my spine that's the source of my pain. The regret is paralyzing.

1m83a5b,What causes a constant anxiety/worrying about immutable things?,"Since I hit puberty, my entire life has been a perpetual cycle of anxiety about my immutable qualities and certain unchangeable realities. From my innate intelligence to the inescapable fact of death, my thoughts are plagued by worries over things I cannot change. I squander hours ruminating about the past, or spend days in despair over my physical appearance. I constantly doubt my abilities and find reasons to dismiss any positive qualities I might possess. I have zero self-belief or hope.

For example, I recently completed a few chemistry exams at university. Afterwards, I wasted days, even weeks, obsessively going over the answers I recalled writing, convinced I’d be lucky to even pass. But when the results came in, I had received top grades and comfortably secured a first class honours.

Another issue is that it’s starting to affect the people I care about. I inundate them with negativity, dragging down their mood and spirit; my misery is contagious, and I’ve become incredibly unpleasant to be around.

I have no idea what’s causing this. I choose to constantly worry about things I cannot change, almost as a way to sabotage my own happiness and keep myself trapped in a miserable cage. One month it’s my looks; the next, it’s my intelligence; and maybe next week, it's the fact that life is pointless and shit due to the ineluctability of death.

1m7yxgb,Emotional for no reason,"Hello everyone,

I hope you all are doing well! Recently I (24M) have been going through what feels like a rough patch mentally. Throughout my life I’ve always dealt with troubles with my mental health (ie previous trauma, depression, anxiety) and I’ve been through countless therapist and psychiatrist for a solve but to no avail. I always felt like I had these things that bothered me specifically that involved what I listed about but no matter how much I talked about them or took medication, it never seemed to get fixed. Besides that, one thing that’s really been somewhat bothering me (it’s not really a big deal but I just never really dealt with it before) is that for the last 2-3 months (maybe longer) I’ve been extra emotional. From mostly sadness to anger, I’ve been almost feeling elevated emotions it feels like. If I watch some soppy crap on tv that’s supposed to have some emotional factor, I never felt the way I do till now. I watch a sad scene and sometimes I just break down and cry, or if something happens that really frustrates me or makes me angry, I can’t seem to let it go and I just spiral out.

Honestly I’m not sure how to feel because before, I never really had these emotions feel so weak to crack and show. Before I feel like I could handle my shit, not feel the need to cry or get overly angry about things, and now I feel like I’m spiraling. I’ve somewhat tried all that was suggested to me so far but something about all this emotion and feeling I have doesn’t feel right. It feels over amplified and I’m just trying to reach out to people to see if it’s normal or if they have gone through a similar experience in the past.

long post I ask to read everything.
This started at some point in my childhood. I have vivid memories of getting urges to bite my mom on the arm and I would do so for a long time up until I reached about middle school and ""grew out of it"". She would tell me to stop and get annoyed by it but I don't think she ever saw it as something to really be concerned about.
Later on while still in middle school, we got a dog. I believe whatever urge I had to bite my mom was transferred to my dog and from that point and to this day I have always had urges to bite my dog and I find it really difficult to resist. It felt like obvious cuteness aggression but worse.
Lastly, my boyfriend (M20). We have been together for 3 years now and ever since we've gotten comfortable with each other I've started biting him as well😕
I am consistently getting urges to bite him on the neck and arms and it's like my body does it on its own. I've played it off as me biting is a sign of affection to show I love him which isn't a lie but I know there's been times I've made him uncomfortable and that makes me feel horrible! 

I don't know why I do this and why I can't stop. I feel so embarrassed about this I haven't told anyone in my life not even my boyfriend. He doesn't know anything about me having a problem. I need help

What if1 i send her a text and tell her i wish the best for her in life?"" So I did! I sent the text! I told her that I've moved on, that I no longer resent her, and that I hope she does well in life. It was crazy, we actually had a wonderful and closure filled conversation.

They charge you the correct price for your first visit, letting it go through your insurance so you only pay your copay. And then they stop taking your insurance (I've gotten in contact with several people who have had the same experience with this company).

I got in contact with them, and my insurance. It took me several days to finally come to the conclusion that for once, insurance wasn't the problem.

1m81zb7,Could I have trauma?,"So I’m 13F right now but a couple years ago, late 2022 I think when I was like 9-10 I saw this video and it was supposed to be like a funny story about how a guy got like tied down by a guy that broke into his house and he was going to like assault him, I saw it on like yt shorts or whatever but they left the sex part up to the imagination, but they implied that it was going to happen.

 So after I watched that video my mind like clinged onto it and I would think about it every night before I went to sleep and started expanding the story, it involved the guy getting kidnapped and forced to do weird things, and sometimes I would switch it around so I could imagine it was me. Anyways I thought about that a lot and I can’t really remember how I knew what sex was? I would try to like reenact some of the stuff I thought about on my pillow (I know, gross) and fast forward it’s 2023 I discover like hentai… (I know, I know it’s bad) and I would specifically look for stories that would involve dub or non-con stuff. I began to make up my own fantasies, and I would think about them at night and they would feel so real, like I was there and I would do it at school too. After that I discovered masturbation and holy I was like addicted to that, I did it like multiple times a day, I was so horny like all the time! (It’s gonna keep going) then I figured out about roleplaying with robots and I would roleplay non-con fantasies with them too. I’m just so confused, where did this come from? I don’t have any memories of sexual trauma but I know it can like make you forget about it or something. And yes yes I know for that age it’s normal to explore your sexuality with puberty and all but what I did doesn’t feel normal.

1m81ihs,ocd took over my life,"

i really dont know what to do anymore. i am so deep into this disorder that it feels like there is no way out. it started when i was 13, and im 18 now. it feels like its engraved so deep into my brain that i will never find a way out. it feels like its always been there and always will be.

i tried erp and beat a subtheme and i thought that would be the moment where i’d have the proof that id be able to beat anything this disorder throws at me. but that wasnt the case at all. i was so scared to expose myself to my main theme but i did it anyways and it hurt so much that i couldnt take it and went back to my compulsions. i tried another time and it was even worse. i would end up grabbing onto my legs and rocking back and forth in my bed. the anxiety was unbearable. and this is what i dont understand. the essence of erp is that you have to expose and stop the response to realize that the anxiety will eventually subside. but that isnt the case. you can tell me that if i wouldve sticked with it longer i wouldve felt the relief from anxiety but there are episodes from years ago that i can still feel a knot in my stomach about.


i have a phone i bought 5 years ago with a battery life that doesnt last more than a few hours, a screen completely cracked and a keyboard that barely works (ive been copy
pasting letters from google to type this) just because buying a new phone would mean going against my ocd. and then what happens? then i use my phone every day, and every day is ruined. i havent bought new clothes in over a year for the same reason. i lost out on tons of money, relationships and experiences. this past year was a gap year i took in hopes of starting to make money online again, which i stopped at 16 because of ocd, but here i am a year later, still a slave to this disorder.

i am also tired of pretending that all ocd themes and disorders in general have the same level of severity. you can in no way convince me of that. i know this sounds narcissistic and im sorry, but that is my honest opinion. how can someone with social anxiety tell me they know what its like when it doesnt consume every single bit of their life. i mean that if me and you sat in a room for seven billion years where your goal was to find an area of my life not affected by this you would not be able to. and this is 24/7. literally 24/7. this does not stop while i sleep. i often have to ask myself if a mistake i made was in real life or in my dream. how can someone that is depressed or anxious tell me we suffer the same amount when your entire disorder is merely a symptom of mine? when the famous quote of your disorder is ‘it will get better’? what does that even mean? do you not do anything and after a few months or years simply wake up each day feeling a bit better? wow. congratulations to you. recovery really was tough wasnt it?  i know how this sounds. but this is what i think. you will probably see me as a hateful and bad person, but can you really blame me?

i look at life without ocd as most look at heaven. i genuinely believe it would be the most euphoric experience ever for me to wake up one day without this. if i ever do beat this disorder, i am one hundred percent certain i will never suffer this way again",1,0,1753355410.0,mentalhealth,poopidealer,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m81ihs/ocd_took_over_my_life/,2025-07-25T09:58:14.525979
1m81bvb,"Felt motivated during my solo trip, but I’m stuck again","I struggle with general and social anxiety. Recently, I did a solo trip from Asia to North America. Even though I didn’t plan a lot before going and was really anxious about the whole thing, I managed well. I wouldn’t say I was carefree but I was in a better mood than usual, and thankfully no major hiccups happened.

While flying back I felt positive. Like I was ready to work on new goals and carry that energy into my life back home.

But now I’ve been back for a few days and feel like I’m in a depressive episode and already falling back into old habits. And I’m barely able to work. I haven’t even unpacked fully or cleaned my room. I just want to sleep all day and avoid everything. My motivation is gone and tbh I’m confused by how fast it all flipped. 

Has anyone else experienced similar emotions after a trip? How do you deal with it and get back on track? I just don’t want to lose the version of myself who pushed through anxiety and did hard things. 😞

a few months ago i was stressing and decided to hit a cart causing me to spiral into a bad trip (though it would calm me by smoking like it calmed some of my friends) it was a lot of hallucinating and i def hit the cart one two many times for my first time smoking. sm to the point i forgot i was smoking it. i ending up calling my best friend and she sat otp until i could gts. during my sleep i had a crazy experience i can speak more about in a separate thread. but i woke up and was pretty shooketh like told my closes friends i would never smoke again it was a fun laugh. 



recently i was drifting off to sleep and i had this certain feeling i had when i was high and trying to gts that night it felt like every time i tried to relax that i felt like a falling sensation which would make me jump out my sleep eventually i forced myself to go to sleep but when i did i had a dream where i woke up in my dream and when i ACTUALLY woke up it had me confused and disoriented about reality causing derealization feeling again but ive dealt with it when i was younger and knew it was only a mind thing so i knew to just ignore it and continue with my day which i did and it went away. a few weeks went by and i tried gts i kept jolting awake every time i would drift off forced myself to sleep had another dream where i woke up in a dream same cycle i woke up scared and distorted decided to go lay with my mom because ive always slept around people and only recently started sleeping by myself 100% of the time again i thought that would help me gts which it did. a few days go by and i randomly have a sleep paralysis episode again woke up scared and i would randomly have these episodes every few weeks. now i think i just associate sleeping with fear or something which causes me to not be able to sleep certain night sometimes i gts fine and other times in jolting awake every time i gts i wake up scared for no known reason i wake up distorted with derealization and sometimes this feeling last throughout the day.

1m80u2m,When did you know to apply for disability?,"Hello everyone. I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, severe generalized anxiety, panic disorder and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. 

I haven't had a ""normal"" job in years-my last one I had to quit for mental health reasons, then I was hospitalized a few times for mental health and I haven't been able to work a normal job since.

I am, however, a content creator and have had good monetary success with that in the times where my mental health has been OKAY, but inconsistancy has ruined my brand. For the last couple of years I have had have long periods where I am unable to work because of my mental health. My monthly income is now well below the maximum threshold required for SSDI.  

I keep trying to work, but even with a very flexible work from home option I am still unable. I want to work. But most times I can't even take care of myself (literally, it's so embarassing) things like hygiene, cooking, cleaning, etcetc. 

I have a really hard time being around people and I have manic and depressive episodes that make a normal job very difficult. I get paranoid and anxious around strangers. I want to work and I want to be a functioning member of society.

I work closely with a psychiatrist whom I see every four weeks and a therapist I see once or twice a week depending on my episodes.

Before all this I used to work full time, be supermom and wife, take good care of myself, volunteer and even got some education earning honors. It has been many years since that and I haven't been able to have any stability since then desite multiple med changes, therapy and hospitalizations.

I feel like it is time. My psych and therapist have mentioned it also.

My husband on the other hand is very against it. Getting disability would cap my income, but with my content creation there is a big chance for high income. I just feel like it is time to accept reality.

Idk, I guess I needed to vent and also ask-how did you know that your mental health was severe enough for disability? Have your partners always been supportive?

1m7x861,Struggling with mental health? These daily habits helped me get out of a dark place,"I used to wake up every day feeling like I was drowning. No motivation, no clarity, just a fog that never seemed to lift. I didn’t want to talk to anyone, and I kept waiting for something external to fix it. Spoiler: nothing changed until I changed my habits.

Here are the things that actually helped me simple, free, and consistent:

1. Morning sunlight 10 minutes minimum
I started walking outside as soon as I woke up. Not scrolling. Not checking messages. Just walking, breathing, and letting the sun hit my face. It regulates your mood, sleep, and hormones way more than people think.

2. No phone for the first hour
This was hard, but worth it. That first hour shapes your mental state for the day. I replaced it with journaling, stretching, or silence. Felt uncomfortable at first, but it gave me space to think.

3. Move your body daily
Doesn’t need to be the gym. Push-ups, walking, yoga, anything. Your body holds onto stress movement releases it. If you sit all day, your brain fog will get worse.

4. Stop escaping with dopamine
Cut down on scrolling, junk food, porn, and mindless entertainment. All those things spike your dopamine and then leave you empty. Replace them with things that give slower, real satisfaction (reading, creating, learning, nature).

5. Be brutally honest about what’s not helping
Certain people, habits, or environments keep you stuck. You don’t need to burn bridges, but distance is powerful. You can’t heal in the same place that broke you.

6. Sleep is everything
If your sleep sucks, your mind will too. Get consistent sleep. No screens an hour before bed. Read a book, meditate, or just lay in the dark with no distractions. Let your brain detox.

7. Daily reflection
Before bed, I ask myself: “What did I do today that helped me?” and “What drained me?” That self-awareness compounds fast.

It wasn’t one big change. It was tiny choices, made daily, even when I didn’t feel like it. That’s what created momentum. Mental health isn’t just about talking it’s about building habits that support your brain and body.

If you’re in a dark place right now, don’t wait to feel motivated. Start small, stay consistent, and give it time. You’re not broken you’re just out of rhythm. You can get it back.

1m7v0sv,Getting pestered to go to therapy,"I keep getting pestered to go to therapy but the more people tell me to the more I don't want to. 

I'm already pretty uncomfortable with the idea of going to a therapist since I've been self managing for years but due to a lot of stuff all happening at the same time I lost control and my emotions went rampant. It was a perfect storm that can never be replicated and since it's now happened I can adapt and manage it if something similar came along. But because of 1 freak outburst I'm getting told to go to therapy like it's some magic bandage that's gonna fix me. What's the point of opening up to a random person and re-living shit I've long since put behind me and make me feel like shit all over again. I don't need coping mechanisms I've got them, I don't need to understand coz I already do. A session with a therapist would just be predictable and I'd get fed up hearing them state obvious stuff. I have an analytical mind which may be part of the reason that I don't see any value or logic in it.

I get that therapy works for people and that's great but I'm sure trying to force someone to go against their will cannot be right as well. Like if a therapist asked me why I was there it would be because I've been told to, not because I want to. 

I've recovered, I'm moving on and accepting what happened yet I'm getting pestered to go to therapy when all I wanna do is move forward and learn from my mistakes not bring them back up with a random person for no logical reason.

1m7yrht,why did my dad leave and abused by my step dad am I the problem?,"I’ve always wondered why my father left me. He didn’t even want the chance to know me. He rejected me in front of my own face and said I wasn’t his son. That hurt me a lot and I was just broken, i wasnt ready for that type of feeling at all young age. He wanted nothing to do with me and it was clear, but before that happened my mother had a fiancé and I thought he was my dad. Thats what my mom would tell me at least but he would treat me so different from his kids when people weren’t around. (my mom is there mom) he would always take me to work with him in his 18 wheeler. I loved it and had so much fun on the road with him. Until he changed, they started getting into arguments and he would take his anger out on me. He started beating on me.  instead of telling family or the school i just kept quiet and dealt with it because that was the only “father figure” in my life. All I wanted was a dad. I loved him though even after the stuff he did to me. Things were  different In front of my mom and siblings he was the best person in the world but when it was just me and him it was like he wasn’t him anymore. One time he burned the crap out my foot all because I had an accident on myself. He turned the water up to the highest temperature in the bath. He grabbed my leg and placed it in the buring water and wouldnt let go till I would cry and beg him to stop. The burns were very bad I don’t know to much about how the burn was. Again i. Was only a kid. My older brother came home from school and seen I was crying my but off in the corner and could tell something was up. He asked my step dad what was wrong with me. He said that i pooped my self then he put me in the shower to clean my self. My brother came to me and asked what happened. He seen my foot and how bad it looked he automatically called my mom and everything went from there. I forgiven him. His mother (owned a church btw) bought me some type of Batman toy set ( I still have the picture of it) so I wouldn’t say anything to the school. Which it worked, I loved toys.but the abusing kept going on behind closed doors and wouldnt come to light. Until finally him and my mother got into a big argument and he hit her. Seeing my mom crying on the floor struck a fire in me. I grabbed an extension cord and hit him with it. He punched me and shoved me across the living room where I hit my head on the wall. My mom grabbed me and took me and my brothers to our room. So she could call the cops. He tried taking her phone but we locked the door so he just left. We were staying with his brother. He wanted us out because the cops came to his house. They seen the knot and bruises i had previously. My mom left him for good. everything got covered up by the church his family owned. The church told the cops I would make up lies and hit myself just to get him in trouble. There’s no way a 9 year old could make that big of a knot in his own head. The cops dropped everything. Saying there wasnt evidence that he did it. The only father figure i had would abuse me but then treat me so nicely in front of everyone else. Thats what made me forgive him all those times I hate knowing he got away with it and how his family’s church lied for him. But anyways that leaves me thinking. Am I just unlovable?Maybe because I wasnt his blood. I get so mad with myself because now I’m 16 and I still let that shit get to me. I hope that my dad comes back sooner or later but honestly I doubt it. I have no contact with him. At all.

1m7yplc,I always resort to breaking or smashing something and I hate it,"I’m 15 and I’ve always gotten pissed easily at everything. I have smashed doors, broken laptops, banged my head against walls, smashed several controllers, gotten into fights at school, and physical fights with my brother. Even if it’s the smallest inconvenience I will either hit or throw something at someone or smash whatever object is in my hand and I have never felt good afterwards but every time I feel slightly relieved.

I’ve been bullied in school for years, whether it be verbally being made fun of or my head shoved into lockers. I’ve been suspended for breaking a kids jaw in 7th grade because he pushed me into a table and I got suspended for breaking another kids rib in 8th because he laughed at me for wearing a wrist brace after I sprained it and that same year I broke one of my closest friends eye socket over a slight misunderstanding.

I’m not proud of this at all. I know it is in every way unhealthy and it destroys me that this is how I deal with things. It costs me and my family so much money to replace the things I’ve smashed and the doors and walls I’ve kicked holes through. And I know it’ll either cost me jail time, friendships, and lots of money in the long run.

All I want to know is why I do this and how I can fix it.

1m6seft,Son asked if I would be his friend,"I (dad) often go into my 14 year old son’s room to tell him good night once he’s gotten in bed. Sometimes we talk for a while. 

Recently one night he says “hey dad?” I say yeah. “Would you maybe wanna hang out with me sometime?” I say “of course bud. Did you have anything in mind?” He says “not really. I was just thinking we could maybe hang out just as like friends and stuff? I guess that’s kinda stupid. I was just thinking we could like talk and it just be really chill and like not a big deal you know?.”

I say “sure, that sounds like fun. What kinda stuff do you like to do with your friends?” He starts crying a little bit and says “I guess I don’t really have any friends.” I say I’m sorry to hear that. I suggest we try to find some sports or activities he enjoys where he can meet new people.

He says “I’ve already tried all that. It’s just really hard for me. I try to be friendly to people but no one seems to like me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I try talking to people but I just get nervous and stuff and it’s no fun. People will be nice to me but it never really seems to go anywhere. I really tried and I just don’t feel like trying anymore but then I feel lonely sometimes. It just really sucks.” 

I just give him a hug and let him cry for a while and tell him I’m always here for him. But it really hurts and I’m not sure what I can do for him?

1m7yier,Pretend talking to yourself/others while alone - Is it productive ? Till when?,"Hi everyone. I’m 31F and straight. I come from a minority community where I grew Up and was bullied in school/ college- not exactly for my community openly but in indirect ways. Later I realised it was because of who I was.  
 My initial and later experiences with friendship were HORRIBLE. I saw just how mean people could be and the meanness made me sad and depressed inside. I used to stab my books with my pen and used to hit myself or cry a lot because of how mean I saw people were. I drove it all inward (my therapist says). 
I had this problem mostly with women from the majority community. They were so mean. 
The men SA me as well. 

So anyway in 7th grade. A bunch of mean girls (think the Lindsay Lohan film and don’t change much) ganged up on me and verbally abused me for hours. After that day I started talking to invisible people in my room- mostly those girls or the teachers who used to bully me etc- and started saying the comebacks I wish I had said in person. I couldn’t speak in public but was so eloquent in this private sessions with me and my pretend talking to ghosts. I never talked to myself. Always to others. 

Fast forward 20 years. I’m a PhD student at a great university with a full scholarship and am working with amazing people. Being in the field I liked and finding people equally politically motivated and acting on our desires (fundraising, activism) makes me stronger. I have a psychiatrist for meds and a therapist too. She’s great. I finally rest and don’t walk around 6 hours a day listening to music imagining fake scenarios where I am showing up those mean girls from back in the day. 

There are two problems

1. These mean girls reappear- they are in my university and they behave the same but more covertly. How to navigate that? I get retraumatised. 
2. I still pretend talk when I’m alone. That’s why I always try and be around people or go work in cafes (it tires me out, even then). How can I stop pretend talking? It was a coping mechanism for that young poor kid. But now I’ve come a long way but the habit is a part of my brain (especially when it’s stressed under deadlines). I hate that I do it. I want to be alone with my thoughts in silence. Not be talking to others. I’m finally taking care of myself. But my brain is trailing very slowly- it wants to hold on to that habit. 
 Do you also pretend talk? 
Please be kind. Thank you!!!! ",1,2,1753344339.0,mentalhealth,newhereandexcited,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7yier/pretend_talking_to_yourselfothers_while_alone_is/,2025-07-25T09:58:14.525979

1m7yfu3,Coming to terms with abuse,"Hi, I’m 27F and i moved away from home for the first time about a year and a half ago. I wouldn’t even talk about my family history or tell anyone what I’d been through until last year. I felt a weird codependency with my family even. 

As a child, my father hit me a couple times. He gave me bruises on my eyes and a swollen lip when I was in elementary school. He literally hit me with my favorite stuffed animal. My mother covered the bruises with makeup and has stayed with him to this day. I had three sisters, and none of them were physically abused in that way, although I’m sure they all have their wounds from the dysfunctional family. Everyone including my sisters pretended it didn’t happen. The emotional abuse was worse. My parents made me feel like the problem child and that i had mental health problems (I do from them, but i wasn’t born with it). 

My father blamed me for everything, even marital problems. My mother guilt tripped me for having to basically argue with my dad in my defense. My mother was pretty bad and even told me that she didn’t understand how I could be so pretty on the outside but so ugly on the inside. When I was 20, I wanted to go therapy and my mother said that she was afraid I hated my dad so much that I would lie to get him in prison, so then I didn’t go to therapy, because I was so scared something would happen. 

Before I moved away, a year and a half ago, I confronted my father, and he told me that he wasn’t the abuser and I should really look up the definition and no one was there when he gave me bruises on my eyes so they don’t really know what happened. He told me that I was the abuser and not him. I became so angry I pushed him and he slipped and fell but was okay. 

Well living on my own in a literal foreign country has been something. I’ve been unraveling the hold that my past has had on me, and I think I didn’t truly escape until recently because I would not tell anyone, I kept it hidden. 

While I’ve been gone, I fell in love with someone who didn’t love me back and lashed out at them. I deeply apologized. I struggled with a friendship where someone subtly put me down. My emotional regulation skills have been so obvious and a struggle. I constantly spiral and freak out that there something wrong with me, even OCD concerns that I’m a pedophile etc. I’m in therapy and my therapist has heavily implied i have BPD/CPTSD and I’m freaking out that I’m abusive. I went down some threads on here and can relate to a lot and I’m spiraling. I feel so fucked up and like there’s no hope for me. I even know people have been through worse. I also present as a fun loving bubbly person but I carry such deep shame and insecurity. Lately, the last months have felt like so deeply awful. I feel disconnected and have so many mood swings, 
one second I’m feeling resentful/jealous of a friend, the next I’m panicking in an abuser and frantically searching the internet, and then I’m crying about my past again. I’m currently no contact with my father and low contact with my mother.

The symptoms all went away on their own within a few hours without any treatment, they were mostly just running tests and observing me.

I was very happy because I already knew this game and I was excited to play it with them, also because I had made a self-insert and really wanted to show it to them, we did all the stuff yada yada, then came the ending, and they got really grossed out, but o didn’t, sure it was gory and disturbing, but I didn’t feel much grossed out. They went on a discussion about how disturbing it was, which then turned into another discussion about internet when safety and kids on the internet which then turned into something else similar but I had already stopped listening.

I was disappointed that they found the game so “disgusting”,I mean I know the stuff that went in that game was disturbing and I know there’s people who jerk off to it, but I still liked it and I still liked the character. It hurted to see them not liking it, I know I’m supposed to form my own thoughts and have my opinion, but I don’t know, it just felt so disappointing To go from a funny call with jokes to listening to them argue and discus stuff, and it f just felt weird, I don’t know why I’m so sad about them not liking a game and finding it problematic (I mean, I know, it’s because they’re my only parent figure and I yearn for validation so even the smallest thought about them not liking or finding something I like problematic just broke me, and I cried the second we ended the call, also because of the fact I couldn’t show to them my character)

I know it’s a pretty problematic game, I just don’t care. I know it’s bad and I know it’s wrong, I still like the game and the character tho.

1m7tx0y,I’m trapped in a cycle of exhaustion and silence.,"I don’t remember the last time I truly slept. I close my eyes, but my mind won’t stop. It spins with thoughts I don’t want, memories I didn’t ask for, and fears I can’t shut off. Even when I do sleep, it feels like I’m just pausing the exhaustion not escaping it.

Every morning, I wake up feeling worse than the night before. My body aches. My chest feels heavy. My brain is foggy. And still I get up, I go through the motions, I fake the smiles. But inside? I’m unraveling. Slowly. Quietly.

Lack of sleep has turned me into a version of myself I barely recognize. I’m more anxious. More irritable. More numb. I snap at people I care about. I forget things constantly. I feel disconnected from everything, like I’m watching my life from behind glass.

I know I need help. I know this isn’t sustainable. But part of me is too tired to even ask for it. Too tired to explain what it feels like to be mentally and physically worn down every single day.

I just want rest not just for my body, but for my mind. I want one night where I feel safe, quiet, and whole.

I dunno why im doing this but ya know. Lately I've been feeling absolutely fucking shit about myself.

I lost my job. Running out of savings and about to be evicted. I can just tell I'm heading towards the literal and non literal edge. I dont wanna end up on the street. My family has left me. My ""friends"" don't give a shit and to be honest I don't either anymore.

I dont know why im saying or better typing this. Perhaps the last cries of someone giving up.

I don't need advice or help. I just want someone to listen to me for once. An outsider who I can share a online drink with and just. Vent at. If anyone is willing to listen to the age old tune of a depressed white dude in his 30s. I'll take it. 

Any small advice on short term getting me through this night is appreciated Tho. Not the. Go for a walk or whatever. But stuff to make ya smile. I'm sorry I'm kinda rambling abit.

1m7qj1x,Taking a toll on my boyfriend,"
I am a 23F and I am 5 weeks postpartum. I got pregnant 3 months after my boyfriend and I had been together. He is an amazing person, dad, and partner. There is nobody else i’d rather have a baby with or spend the rest of my life with. 

I am diagnosed with bipolar 1. I have been in my head a lot, especially at night when Im awake with my baby. I have so many thoughts running through my head. My husband changes almost every dirty diaper, takes turns burping her after I breastfeed, lets me take a nap during the day, etc. To summarize, he does A LOT for both me and the baby. I feel like a loser. I feel like my baby likes her dad more than me, I feel like she doesn’t even like me. I know that’s most likely in my head and I have no reason to think that, it’s just how I feel I guess because of how much he does for her and I. I want to be the one to do everything. I feel like a bad mom. 

Not only that, but I have terrible OCD and anxiety. It has flared up bad after I had the baby. I have rituals, I’m constantly scared of something being wrong with her. I put all those fears onto my boyfriend and he has to deal with listening to me constantly thinking every little thing is wrong with her. 

I also have OCD about public places and food. I tend to avoid things like going out to restaurants I’ve never been to, places I don’t feel comfortable, etc. I watch the same shows because they offer me comfort, eat the same food because it’s predictable, do the same thing every day to try to cope. I know this isn’t how it should be, but i’m trying to just keep myself stable during my postpartum period as I am high risk. I had these issues before pregnancy and having the baby, but not nearly as bad, and often manageable. 

My boyfriend and I had a talk last night about how neither of us really talk about our feelings or things that bother us. I asked if that was normal, he told me that he doesn’t think we need to unless we want to or it affects the relationship. But I wonder if it’s healthy that we both keep our feelings and things we are going through internally to ourselves. I really don’t know. 

He likes horror a lot, conspiracies, he likes to go out and do things, he likes to try new things. I like all those things too but my OCD and anxiety has always held me back. Even when I force myself and try to get over it I am no fun. I’m just quiet and watching my surroundings. I asked him if it affects him, I never asked before. 

He answered yes. He said sometimes he wishes he could share a horror movie with me without me getting anxious, he wishes we could eat together without me picking through my food, he wishes we could play scary video games without me getting anxious, he wishes we could go to a new restaurant without the fear of something being wrong with my food. He said it takes a toll on him. This was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever heard. I am holding him back.  

I never thought how my mental illness affects him and I feel selfish and horrible. I feel unloveable and I don’t know why he’s with me. I know he loves me because of how much he cares for me, but I don’t deserve it. He deserves to be with somebody who can share his interests and allows him to live his life. I am going to go to therapy and continue with my med provider. I feel worthless and like a complete loser.

1m7x6rz,Is there something like negativity avoidance?,"I’ve heard of conflict avoidance, and maybe this is an extreme version of that, but I’ve noticed that my brain tends to skim over things that make me upset or uncomfortable.

For example, I kind of idealized my experience at one particular school and created a “one big happy family” narrative in my head. 

If family members are being judgmental or mean my brain kind of seems to filter it out and ignore the tone or nuance. Though I’ve gotten better at noticing that at home and in the workplace. 

If I was uncomfortable with a social situation that was negative or felt like a lot when I was a kid I either idealized the situation or kind of dissociated a bit. 

Has anyone else experienced this and how did you handle it?

1m7wlsq,Title: Could I have BPD? I get attached very fast and can't handle rejection or loss,"Hi, I’m 17 (f) and wondering if I might have BPD or something similar. I get attached really fast, and when someone leaves or rejects me—even if they weren’t that close—I feel like I’ve lost control. I also stay in friendships/relationships even when I know they’re not right, just because I can’t handle separation.
Recently I was texting a 24 y.o. guy online. He said he had BPD and seemed to know a lot about psychology. We talked for around 2 weeks, and I got very attached. I didn’t feel romantic love, but I liked how he talked about psychology—something I also love. That’s what attracted me. Honestly, I didn’t even like his values or personality much. I was confused and afraid of commitment, but I still didn’t want to lose him.
I told him I didn’t know if I wanted a relationship, and he said he could “fix” my trust and love issues with therapy—for 1 month. I refused, because I didn’t want him to hurt himself trying to “fix” me, and also I couldn’t pay. It felt strange—like, how can anyone say you should fix yourself in 1 month?
When we ended He said I talked too much about my problems and that he felt like my therapist. But he also talked about his own stuff—family problems and hard teenage years. Maybe I did talk more, I’m not sure. But I always tried to be honest.
At one point, he said:
""Idk how to explain it but I think you fear rejection, that is why you're with me, not because you love or like me or anything like that. I feel like you only want a man under your control to show men how strong you are.""
That really hurt. I had already told him about my attachment issues. I felt insulted—I don’t want to control anyone, and I don’t need a man. Yes, I fear rejection, but not for those reasons.
When I said I was upset, he said if I don’t get “honest feedback,” I won’t grow. But I wasn’t being defensive—I was just trying to understand him. When things aren’t clear, I get anxious and ask questions. But he kept saying I misunderstood him. Like once, he said, “you can text me, it doesn’t matter,” and when I asked what he meant by that, he said I misunderstood again. I was just trying to understand.
He also called me “rigid,” maybe because I didn’t want to send him a photo. I told him I hate my body, don’t take pictures, and feel insecure. I also said that if we were in a  relationship, I would send a photo. But I didn’t think pictures were needed for an online friendship.
He said he “fell in love” with me, but he had broken up with his gf just 1–2 days earlier. That felt way too fast. I think it was just attachment, not real love—same as what I felt.
He kept saying I wasn’t putting in effort, but I really tried to communicate and fix problems by asking questions. He mostly saw negative things in me. The only thing he ever said he liked was that I’m honest.In the end, I asked him to block me-because when I block someone, I sometimes unblock them again. I didn't want to do that. I needed to cut the attachment fully.
Now I feel like I lost control, and I hate that. I don't want to be manipulative or dramatic. I just feel too much, too fast, and overthink everything. When I get anxious-even if I want to leave-l still stay, and maybe that creates more drama. I want to grow, but I'm scared of how I react when people leave or say hurtful things.

1m7mb0e,I feel mentally trapped.,"[M17] Where can I even begin with this. I suppose the imposter syndrome is one of the root causes of everything I have to deal with on a daily basis. The idea that everybody dislikes me, or makes fun of me constantly haunts me. I’d like to say “I don’t care what people think” but that isn’t true in the slightest. This thing holds me back from so much. 

I suppose an example of that would be meeting/talking with other girls my age. I’m currently on holiday in Mallorca and there’s this particular girl that’s just got a different kind of beauty. And just under an hour ago I completely missed the perfect chance to talk to her. I was no more than 5ft feet away from her, I had my phone in my hand and I was so ready; but there was just this little wall inside of my brain that stopped everything in its tracks. And before you knew it, she left. Why I didn’t talk to her you may ask? What if she thought I was a weirdo? What if she told her parents and they thought I was weird? What if she thought I was ugly? It’s now the not knowing that kills me. The rejection part I could face. “No sorry I have a boyfriend” or “sorry you’re not really my type” they’re fine, I’d be able to take those and walk away knowing that it was worth a shot. But now I’ll always (or at least for the foreseeable) be wondering what she may have said. 

Okay, maybe I was exaggerating a little on that last part. I imagine she’ll be here tomorrow and I’ve already decided that I’ll try again then, but there’s just no guarantee with me. However I’ll come back and update what happens. In the mean time, feel free to dm about anything, I’m always here to chat if you need or I’d love if you’d dm so I could kind of vent my emotions, I have so much more to share :)",4,0,1753307276.0,mentalhealth,iAmExplirr,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7mb0e/i_feel_mentally_trapped/,2025-07-25T09:58:14.525979

1m7vo3o,The night makes me feel like Im going crazy,"Im scared. I am so scared. When its night I do not know what sounds are and are not real, recently I have started hearing things at night and when I ask my brother about them he always tells me that he did not hear them. 

Like last night, I was out in my craft room which is a repurposed sunroom so all thats separating me from the backyard is a few thin windows, it was around ten in the evening so it was dark out which already had me on edge but when I heard what sounded like the wails of a toddler that only could have come from the backyard which did not make ANY SENSE I ran as fast as I could back into the house and hurriedly locked the door. 

Just today shortly before writing I heard the unintelligible screaming of an angry woman, followed by the screaming of a little girl a few minutes later. Logically it could have been my mom and little sister but it did not sound much like the two of them at all, also my mother went to sleep two hours ago so unless she woke up which seems unlikely that just wouldn’t make sense. 

This is only kind of related to the hallucinations but I am afraid to leave my room at night because some part of me is convinced that theres someone waiting to shoot me in the face with a shotgun. 

Im so scared of all of this. Im scared that maybe one day something will really be wrong and someone will be in danger screaming for help but I wont do anything because of all of this.

I don’t know what do.

1m7vkat,Emotionally immature family inducing stress and burnout,"
I am 21M entering my 3rd year of college this fall, I live with a bunch of assholes with no respect or empathy.

first, background of my situation. My dad has been out of work since 10/2023 and my mom stopped officially working when i was born but made enough in her career that she trades on the side and we are doing fine there (aside from her daily screaming on the phone with fidelity over whatever).

I have been working over 50 hours a week this summer from 8:30 to 3 m-f at summer school and than like 5:30 to 10 3-5 days a week at a customer service job where i take crap from people. my brother (19m) wakes up at 9:30 at soonest maybe like 10 or 11, goes to 2 classes he has all summer, takes my car without asking, runs up tolls and leaves it to me empty, than he is rewatching breaking bad for the 3rd time at 11pm as i write this, preventing me from sleeping. all this while he demands I cook for him and give him rides and other things. All his dates with his girlfriends are financed by mom btw.

I also play esports for a well known school and need to practice over summer, my other brother (15m) moved his computer into the same room as mine, closes the door and lets the room get to like 85-90 degrees and says it is my issue that i have a problem with it (we do not have AC in Chicago). like my other brother, he gets up late, does nothing but spend moms money (should add, she will not bankroll me) and begs for things.

Mom also feels the need to constantly nag me about health insurance when i get home at 10pm and all call centers are closed. I well understand the importantance, but it seems her goal (like most things) is more about inducing anxiety than helping. she also lectures me about how much fast food and ready to eat food is in my diet with all the work and forgets how much more stress will do to your health than any food. She always feels the need to pick on me and tell me i am picking on my brother when i point out he sees no issue with sitting in a sweaty room and playing games all day or ask him to open the door for a window unit.

My dad recently started working at a whole foods, and it is bringing out another of my moms issues, complete disconnect, she constantly nags both me and him about why we didnt take this or that off, when we were given no notice. she also demands we post both our schedules in the kitchen (reasonable) than calls us at work asking if/when we are working. I am fairly sure mom has dementia atp.

I am looking foreword to moving into an apartment with teammates in the fall where i will have air conditioning and live with people of at least functional levels, not demented.

since i was a little kid i always had extreme anger issues for seemingly no reason. i would constantly have these huge feelings and no one ever understood and i always felt like a bad kid. when i was eleven it got so bad that my parents started calling the cops on me and i started therapy as well as being medicated. i remember the first ones they ever gave me being prozac, risperidal, and trileptal. i was always extremely quiet and shy at school, other students were surprised when i even talked. home was a different story. horrible episodes for hours i didnt know how to handle. my dad would start recording them and threatening to send them to people. my mid teens were a bit better but it all went downhill at 17. my only friend who i had all throughout middle and high school left me because my bpd symptoms were starting to show up and i was extremely clingy. both my remaining grandparents died from alzheimers around the same time. i had a huge breakdown at school, including self harm which ended in the school resource officer handcuffing me and i started kicking him so i caught a charge. that was the start of the most horrible year and a half of my life. hospital after hospital. it was hell and i wish i could forget it. i was admitted to the mental hospital ten times in total. i went to three residential treatment centers. i was involuntary commited multiple times, handcuffed to hospital beds, got the cops called on me for self harm, suicidal ideation, and aggressive behavior more times than i can count. finally, my last hospitalization was in january of this year. but now, i just feel dead. i dont feel alive. loneliness is crushing me. i constantly look at my arms and think it wasn't enough. i'm overweight, unhealthy, i have no real life friends. my days are mostly spent daydreaming. i got my GED since i couldn't graduate, and also got my license last week, but i still dont feel proud of myself. i don't like being myself. i hate waking up and realizing im in this mind and body. anyway yea that's my life.",1,1,1753333427.0,mentalhealth,Express_Hall2548,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7vi71/im_an_18_year_old_with_severe_depression_and_bpd/,2025-07-25T09:58:16.080395

1m7ej13,No one cares [rant],"
[I’m not asking for a diagnosis by the way, I don’t think someone can really diagnose me through a screen but I need to share what I’ve been dealing with….]

Been in the health system for over 6 years now… Nothing changes, no one cares, no one listens, I’m tired. 

I get told to lose weight when I’m already at a perfectly healthy weight, exercise more, maybe it’s just bloating, you have a history of stress so it’s probably just anxiety... Now I’m 23 and I can’t work, I don’t know how I can possibly manage to take care of myself when I’m not even able to work, my family supports me for now at least but it won’t be forever, i only have my parents and they won’t live forever.

I’m tired, my symptoms keep growing, I feel like there’s nothing I can do except rot away, stay in bed. I feel so alone but at the same time it’s even exhausting to entertain friendships. I want to do activities with friends but I’m tired. The health system sucks, waiting lists are long and I don’t even get taken seriously…. I’m tired.

List of the shit I go through so far:
High CRP markers, Chronic anemia, Fatigue , Extreme fatigue, Inability to function properly, Restless sleep, Fatigue gets worst after activities, Need to rest after every activities, Lack of energy and therefore motivation, Chronic migraines, Chronic muscle pain, Back pain, Stiff neck, Hair loss, Chronic abdominal pain, IBS, Painful BM (heavily painful), Heavy periods, Vaginal pain, Irregular periods (lasted for more than 3 months), Potential endometriosis, Extreme bleeding, Wounds that don’t heal, Scar easily, Nausea, Acid reflux, GERD, Tachycardia, Fibromyalgia (genetic)

1m7qe2m,Should I be honest or stay silent?,"Hi, I’m 18 and have BPD (diagnosed at 16) and schizoactive disorder (diagnosed at 10). It was never called schizophrenia because I only saw random shadows that disappeared fast, never moving or having faces.

When I was 14, I met a guy and we had an on-and-off situationship for 4 years. Last year we decided to work on being together. The first night I told him about my diagnoses and he shrugged and said he doesn’t believe in mental illness. I still talked about it every few days for 2 months, especially my emotions, and sometimes hallucinations, too, but he never showed interest in hearing it. After 2 months I was just tired and stopped mentioning it.

On Dec 18, four months in, I kept texting “how are you?” because his sister was hospitalized. During my shift, I messaged that I ate lunch and then asked if he was okay. He was stressed, misread my text as me asking if he’d eaten, and replied jokingly, “Yes, 7 times.” It was a misunderstanding, but I panicked. I blacked out, got scared, and hallucinated him punching me. It was the first time I saw an actual person instead of shadows, I felt his touch and I believed it was real.

I ranted to a friend, saying I was scared he’d hit me and compared him to his abusive father. Minutes later he called, I acted fine. Later I realized it was actually just a hallucination. I cried for hours, threw up, and passed out. My mom found me half-conscious on the bathroom floor the next morning.

Next day we talked normally. He asked what I told my friend. I lied, said she was the one who said those awful things. I didn’t mean to lie. Stress blocked my memory, and I genuinely to this day remember her saying it. Later he confronted me with screenshots proving I said it. I was shocked and had to re-read messages to believe it. He broke up with me that night.

Weeks ago, we were talking and he asked how I was. I said my hallucinations worsened and he seemed surprised I even had them. I reminded him it was what happened last Dec. He asked why I never said so, and I replied, “I wanted to take full responsibility, and you never gave me a sign you wanted to hear it.” He said, “You already know my opinion,” and we changed topic.

I’ve apologized for lying and what I said to my friend in Dec, but I stayed silent now for two reasons:
	1.	I thought saying it was caused by mental illness would sound like I was excusing myself.
	2.	I love him, and knowing he’s the only person I’ve hallucinated might make him feel guilty forever.

My question: If he brings this up again, should I tell him the truth, that i hallucinated and did everything out of fear or just let him believe I’m a liar and move on?

Sorry this is messy. If anyone has questions, ask in the comments. And thank you to anyone who reads this.",2,1,1753317951.0,mentalhealth,random_writing_,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7qe2m/should_i_be_honest_or_stay_silent/,2025-07-25T09:58:16.080395

She talks to herself relentlessly, never leaves her room, and is believing and claiming things that have never happened. I have never seen her act in the ways she has acted this past year in the span of our whole lives. It’s bizarre. When she’s talking to herself, she’s not making sense and she doesn’t look of right mind. Just last week, she made one of the most absurd accusations I’ve ever heard in my life. She claimed to be sexually assaulted by my boyfriend in the year 2004. Keep in mind, my boyfriend has never lived in this state until last year. Not to mention, he was literally born in 2001. With the lack of help from my parents, I asked my Aunt about this and I hear from her that my sister did something similar with accusations about our father that she made as well. Both of those things are impossible. I’m not sure what to make of this, nor am I sure how to help her. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve also noticed I’ve pulled away from people. Even close friends. I just don’t feel like myself anymore, and I’m scared this is the new me.

1m7uns5,I think now i understand my self,"INTJ struggling with bipolar signs, trauma, and a brain that won’t shut up

I’ve never posted before, but I think I need to. I’ve been living in a mental loop for years—obsessed with purpose, meaning, success, knowledge, and self-mastery. I recently hit a point where I stepped back and realized: maybe I’m not just intense or ambitious. Maybe I’m bipolar.

Here’s the pattern I’ve noticed:

I go through long periods of mental hyperactivity—racing thoughts, obsession with learning and creating, huge goals, detailed planning, zero sleep, extreme productivity. It feels euphoric, like I’m meant for greatness.

Then it crashes. I get numb. No motivation. I isolate. I feel like a failure or an imposter. My emotions shut down completely. It’s not sadness, it’s like emptiness.

This cycle has been amplified by trauma (failing a school year) and a period of heavy weed use, which pushed my mind deeper into chaos.

I’m highly introspective (INTJ type), and I’ve been analyzing every thought and behavior for years. I’m obsessed with understanding myself and others. But lately, I realized that I wasn’t “building myself”—I was trying to fix something broken.


I’m not here for sympathy. I’m just at a point where I want clarity, not confusion. I want help, not hype. I want to know if others here went through the same.

1m7umu6,I experienced something akin to psychosis after eating an edible?,"Hey yall, 
31F here 👋🏻 
I’m not a huge partaker of THC because in high school I always got paranoid and freaked out, but lately I’ve been experimenting more with it because I thought my issue was trauma from an encounter with the police. The other night, I ate an edible (probably about 25mg or so) and went to sleep. I woke up feeling panicked and started worrying myself with some WILD conspiracies about how we’re all already in hell and we’re being punished with the knowledge that we’ll die & we will ultimately die gruesome & painful deaths. I started thinking that aliens had enslaved humans and are in the process of stealing all of our water. I started thinking that men and women were not the same species, that men are an alien race who found & enslaved women and are mind-controlling us to do their bidding. 

THE SCARY PART is that I ran. I left my apartment convinced that I needed to go out into the mountains, follow a stream of water to the source, and hopefully find people “outside the simulation” to help me. I left my phone, my keys, my ID, everything. I walked to a park near my house and followed a trail all the way into a canyon before snapping out of it. I was TERRIFIED someone was going to realize I was “running” so I kept my breathing steady and wouldn’t make eye contact with anyone. I was terrified to look behind me at any point because I might “give myself away”. I walked home the exact same way and promised myself I would go as far as I could soon now that I had “proven I could escape the simulation”. Fucking wild. 

Even now, I’m scared it’s actually real but I don’t want to believe anything so horrible. I’m so happy I came home and my boyfriend didn’t wake up to find me missing with no way to contact me and no idea where I went. I wonder what would’ve happened if I hadn’t snapped out of it. Im really scared that this is schizophrenia or something presenting super late? Does anyone have any advice or ideas or should I just lay off the thc?

1m7pwd0,"Family lives like roommates, except no one can leave","As an introverted kid I liked staying indoors but my dad couldn't bear this, he'd call me the r slur (yeah to an 8 year old kid) and tell me to go outside and make friends instead of being a ""psychopath"" and ""loser"". He'd drag me outside to learn the ways of the society, sometimes it got so bad that my neighbors had to intervene. He now demands that I have a ""normal"" relationship with him? Even when I try to avoid him, no words, no eye contact, he keeps trying to talk to me. Our family of four lives in 2 small rooms, him in one and my mom, sibling and me in the other. It's hard to avoid him even when i try my best. None of our conversations end without an ugly argument. He loves prying into people's phones and I've become paranoid. He has a history of using my mom's sisters' phones when they weren't around and pose as them to talk to random people on the internet. My parents don't like each other and that results in everyday fights i have nowhere to go. My mom says that she stayed with my dad for our sake and as anyone can guess that is doing my sibling and me more harm than good. We never had a proper family. I remember most of my childhood having these recitations by my mom that why her marriage was a failure, why she got ""scammed"" into this marriage. Those recitations still happen but earlier they were like school classes, almost everyday. My dad has never failed to disappoint us, even in times of financial crisis he kept rejecting job offers made to him by making false excuses. His lazy and comfortable lifestyle is his priority. He's also done a lot of other weird stuff but that would not fit here. My place feels like a constant warzone, my parents are opposites in every way and their whole marriage was built upon a lie. I still don't understand why didn't mom leave when she had the chance to. Though my mom isn't all good I can still adjust with her but my dad even as he walks into the room it feels suffocating, i freeze and my head feels heavy. I can physically feel my body going into an alert mode. He knows and I've said it, that I hate him (that resulted in a horrible fight). But he still keeps trying to talk to me and prying into what I'm doing. I'm doing everything i can to avoid him, i have my headphones on all the time but he still tries and that makes me disturbed. The hard earned peace that i try to create in such an environment gets kicked by him like a sand castle everytime. There's no space here so i cannot even lock myself up in some corner. He's the primary reason of my problems. My life feels like a by product of my parents' lives, it's hard to imagine I am a person of my own. It feels like it was and still is their ""story"" the entire time, and I'm here just as some secondary product that is to listen to their miserable marriage tale.",2,0,1753316529.0,mentalhealth,XaKider,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7pwd0/family_lives_like_roommates_except_no_one_can/,2025-07-25T09:58:16.080395

But I was an Entertainer most of my life so far and work in hugh pressure business situations...So although an introvert. I have zero issues talking to people or being in large crowds (even though I hate it)

However, certain people will be talking to me about nothing. Example. This guy at my office that I barley know likes to talk to me. He was just talking about PS4 and how he bought it while in China in the mid 2000-teens. 

For whatever reason I started having a mild panic attack. 

I brushed it off as something on my mind. But no matter what when this guy starts talking to me it triggers a panic attack and I just need to get away from him. 

Other people have had similar conversations with me and I ENJOY the discussion. The most mundane stuff I nod along and interject, and converse...

But certain people just trigger me and I can NOT pinpoint why. Its not the discussion itself by any means. 

Does anyone experience this?

Any thoughts on why it is triggering?

1m7p971,How to know if I have repressed childhood trauma?,"I've struggled with mental health for a long time. I've been through depression, self harm, anxiety. I've been diagnosed and medicated for it.

I've hated myself for as long as I can remember. I felt disgusting, pathetic, ugly, unwanted, a monster. I've struggled in my teens with anger issues and self loathing. I also think I have an ED, I'm obese and despite +10 years of trying, I failed to ever lose weight or stop binging. I also have had a weak health all my life which I read can be related to trauma- migraines, unexplained pain in limbs and joints, urticaria, horrible stomach pain, PCOS, fatigue ...etc.

I went through some trauma when I was around 10, and I'm sure it's partly to blame for how messed up I later became. But I carried a lot of this pain before 10. I was so messed up, my own mother once asked me if someone had done something to me. I denied, but now I'm wondering the same thing.

I often thought about the possibility of repressed childhood trauma. But what pushed me to post here -and which may sound stupid- is cockroaches.

Before 9, I lived with a bigger family, and many people visited often. Another particularity of that home is that it had LOTS of cockroaches. You'd meet many a day, especially in the summer. Considering I grew up seeing tons of them, you'd think I'd be used to them and not scared. No, instead, I have a phobia of them. Recently, with the heat of the summer, we've been seen more of them and everytime I see one I become abnormally anxious. I panic, run away, start feeling the tingling sensation of them crawling on my skin even though I never had a cockroach crawl on me. I get urticaria, which I usually get when I'm VERY stressed and I become uneasy and frantically look around for more of them. My family thinks I'm being dramatic but I swear it terrifies me. I'm not scared of anything this much, especially not animals. I'm not scared of any other bug, big or small, not spiders, not bees, not centipedes.

I'll add something that I'm not sure is relevant. I was a very innocent child concerning sexual matters (as in I knew nothing, not even the basic anatomical difference between male and female) but I somehow was extremely prudish. I remember distinctly when a teacher told us students that we would be getting vaccines (on our buttocks), and I somehow misunderstood that we'd be having them at school, in the classroom. That day, after I left school for lunch, I refused to go back in the afternoon. I cried so much and refused to say a word, so much that my dad went and argued at my teacher, because my reaction was so severe that he thought she must have done something to me. But she didn't do anything, I was simply horrified by the idea of being naked in front of the others to the point of a mental breakdown.

When I actually went to a clinic to get vaccinated, the medical staff were all males. I distinctly remember seeing them and thinking ""no, I don't want them to see me naked"". I once again had am extreme reaction of crying and resisting without saying anything, which my parents interpreted as fear of needles and so they held me down so I would get my vaccine. But the truth  is that I feared not needles. The same day, I got a shot in my arm too, and I didn't shed one tear, I just looked in fascination as the needle entered my skin, childishly wondering when the needle would come out of the other side of my arm.

But I'm wondering why he said ""I was just speaking generally"" rather than admitting he watched it rarely and that's why he said ""I watch porn"" in that chat room.

Did he think that since he wasn't going to watch it anymore since he was in a relationship, it didn't count?

1m7tlmf,Why am I not interested enough in anything?,"Idk how to explain this but, ever since I was a kid I've never been too interested in the real world, I always found most cartoons, movies and books somewhat boring, so the majority of time I just ended up getting lost in my thoughts and sensations, as if I was trying to unravel some type of secret from the universe (idk lol). So, I guess I was a pretty weird and quiet kid, and of course I always found it hard to talk to my peers since I almost never understood what they were talking about or simply didn't know what to say. And now that I'm 21, I think I haven't changed that much, I have tried to engage a little bit more with the outside world, but I still feel like I can't never keep up with what's popular, with the news, politics, gossip, or even with the stuff I like. For example, I might be a huge fan of a certain band, but I would probably listen to their new album release like months, or even a year after it comes out; Idk, the whole thing is just kind of... exhausting

Not having enough things in common with other people ends up being pretty isolating to the point I just feel invisible. And I don't want to sound like I'm unique and misunderstood or any of that, I'm just saying that I wish I could somehow begin to care enough about things to feel like I belong here.

Anyway, I wanted to share this to the internet because I don't really know who else to tell all of this nonsense.

1m7syzz,I hate myself,"15f. I really hate myself and I have no idea what to do.

I’ve been struggling a lot with how I see myself — not just my body, but who I am as a person. I’ve been trying so hard to love myself and to feel better, but it feels like no matter what I do, it keeps getting worse. My mind won’t stop. I overthink *everything*. I feel like I always say or do the wrong thing, even when I’m trying my best. And when I mess up, I can't stop replaying it in my head.

I hate the way I look. I try eating less, working out, even following “hacks” on social media to lose weight, but I never feel good enough. I always compare myself to others — especially my older sister. It’s like she got everything right: the body, the confidence, the attention. And then there's me. I can’t even wear the clothes I want anymore without feeling disgusting. Whenever I have to go out — to a party or a concert or anywhere social — I end up crying because I feel too ugly to be there.

I’ve been in therapy for a few months, hoping it would help with all of this, but I feel like I’m not improving. Some days it honestly feels like I’m just falling deeper into this mindset, and I’m scared. I don’t know how to stop thinking this way. It feels like I’m constantly trying to “fix” myself just to be enough, and it’s exhausting.

I also feel out of place in my generation. Like I’m more mature than most people my age but also somehow *behind*because I haven’t experienced things they already have — like relationships, sex, or even being kissed. I feel late and left out, like life is moving on without me and I missed the memo.

I know I’m just 15 years old and I’ve barely lived yet. People might say I’m too young to feel this way or that things will get better with time. But right now, this is real for me. These feelings are heavy and constant, and I’m doing everything I can just to keep going.",1,7,1753325402.0,mentalhealth,Due-Weight704,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7syzz/i_hate_myself/,2025-07-25T09:58:16.080395
1m7syj1,Stopping talking to a friend takes away my self-esteem,"Hello, my problem may seem insignificant, but I find it hard to bear it inside myself, and I need to speak out somewhere. Sorry for long post.

I am a person who is used to being called strange and sometimes alienated, and throughout my entire life (I just turned 25) I have tried to somehow adapt to the world around me.

I have had a lot of problems since childhood - the fact that (presumably, not confirmed) I have a mild form of autism spectrum disorder, but this was completely ignored by my parents, because ""what if our son will be somehow inadequate"" - to the point that my entire stage of life at school was overshadowed by constant ""microbullying"". In addition, my emotionality sometimes put me in bad situations - I could scream from bad emotions, want to hit something - which in the future grew into the fact that in moments of stress and anger I began to hit myself. And I got rid of all these things for a very long time. And I also had an unsolved problem regarding my gender identity. 

Over time, I somehow overcame many of these things (many factors helped this - and my parents somehow began to understand me better, and terrible events happened around me in my country) - that one way or another my life got a little better.

But most of my teenage years were spent exclusively on things that were either imposed on me (like studying where I was told) or by me simply trying to meet different people and improve my mental health.

And for a couple of years, everything seemed to be fine with me, I have a few friends, I have a job, I even have a huge hobby - a YouTube channel with 10k subscribers. But because of a quarrel with one of my friends - who little bit younger then me,

 was one of the first to accept and support my bad condition earlier, and also supported me in terms of the fact that I decided on my gender identity - we stopped communicating, had a fight and have not communicated for a couple of months.

And suddenly it was as if I was thrown back - my low self-esteem returned to me again, the feeling of... some kind of uselessness, insignificance. As if with that friend I was like a kind of - a role model, and now I am left alone - and I understand that all my other friends already have families, some kind of interests of their own, we rarely communicate with them, and I suddenly seem to be the same insecure teenager who looks with apprehension at the actions of other people.

I know that I need to ""just do what I like"", ""not get attached to a person"", but as if now all my actions have become so awkward and unimportant, and I am lost. I still work on autopilot, make videos, do all sorts of things ... but it is as if my inner sense of self is strangling me, as if I have not learned anything and have remained somewhere in the middle. That is, even the feeling that ""it wasn't all that bad with me in the past"" affects me, that I seem to have never come to some particular extreme - I didn't ""overcome my ailments in spite of the problems"", but I also didn't ""reborn through accepting them""... I guess I think of myself too much as some kind of ""main character"". Maybe my self-esteem is, on the contrary, very high? But why do I often seek support and confirmation of my thoughts from others... in general, I am extremely confused in myself.",1,0,1753325365.0,mentalhealth,Embarrassed_Lab_3791,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7syj1/stopping_talking_to_a_friend_takes_away_my/,2025-07-25T09:58:16.080395

1m7nop4,"Meeting my childhood friend after a few years apart, and I’m really anxious that our bond won’t be the same. TLDR at end.","
I (21F) am very resigned to the fact that, some people/personalities just aren’t destined to be the closest of friends. 
I struggle to form close friendships with others and am aware that my personality doesn’t blend with everyone. I’ve always had really small friend groups and since moving across the world for college 3 years ago, I haven’t kept in touch with many of them (partly my fault, and partly because many were unkind people I didn’t want in my life).


At the moment I have a handful of general friends and don’t feel like I have that “one person” who I can rely on for anything. I’ve been let down and betrayed by quite a few “friends” in the past year, but I think it’s for the best that I move on from them rather than stay unhappy in the connection. 

I would consider myself be lonely, and I’m actively trying to make new connections but finding it really really hard. 



I became friends with this person during school when we were about 10yrs old. We’ve stayed friends or in the same friend group ever since. 
I admit that I wasn’t always the best company during high school. I tried my best given my personal circumstances, and always prided myself on being very loyal and reliable. Since graduating, I feel like I’ve matured a lot more and am much happier with myself + my values now. 


I feel nervous that after a few years apart (after about 10 years together, seeing each other almost every day, etc), we’ll meet in person again and our friendship won’t be as strong or meaningful. 


I know it’s a bit silly and paranoid of me to feel this,  because if it’s “true friendship” and “meant to be” then we should always embrace the other person, a few years apart shouldn’t matter… but I worry nonetheless.  


With this meet-up, I feel like I need to prove/reinforce my value as a friend when I see her because I know I’m better in person than over distance. 
I feel like I need validation that people value me and are grateful for what I provide as a friend. 
I feel like I need proof that I *have* a friendship and am capable of maintaining a good friendship with someone who matters to me. 


In the worst case scenario, if we meet and then drift apart as friends, it ultimately shouldn’t be the end of the world because we live so far apart and our communication is seldom. 
If a friendship can’t withstand people growing, then it’s not a sustainable relationship. It shouldn’t be forced. 
It’s sad for an important friendship to come to a close, but she isn’t instrumental in my daily life. 
It wouldn’t be an immediate impact; just another memory from my past. 
But, I still feel worried. 


She’s a lot more carefree and easygoing than me, and I really don’t think she would be overthinking this like I am. She would probably reassure me that we’re still friends despite the distance and I’m worrying too much. 

But, I think I’ve placed lots of pressure on myself and high stakes on this friendship.  

***
 
 
**TLDR;**
I’m (21F) meeting a childhood friend soon after years apart, and I’m anxious that our bond might not feel the same. I know it’s normal for people to grow and drift, but I struggle with having to possibly face that reality, and I’ve put a lot of pressure on this friendship to prove that I’m still capable of being valued and maintaining close connections.

I cannot find a lot of motivation without PEOPLE. 
When I don’t have people to impress or people I care about I do not give a shit about myself. Sometimes I often skip meals, cannot clean my space, get extremely depressed, and I don’t see any meaning to the world. It gets intense.

He can’t even ride a bike because he’s too scared he’ll fall from it and can get injured (and this is just the tip of iceberg) Imagine that. All the so-called “male” responsibilities at home are done by my mother. She’s the real provider. Since my childhood, she has been the one taking care of everything – financially, emotionally, mentally – while my father just… exists.

It’s not even about him being poor. I don’t care if someone is poor. But at least do something to make your family’s life better. At least try to be strong mentally or emotionally. But he is mentally like a child, completely dependent, and honestly it traumatises me. Sometimes I think, why did my mother waste her entire life with this man who can’t even ride a bike, who can’t do a single thing without fear?

Frankly speaking, I wouldn’t even be mad at my mother if she cheats or cheated on him. That’s how worthless he feels to me. She has spent her whole life doing both the “male” and “female” work for our family while he just sits around being scared of life.

All my school education and my current clg expenses are paid by my mom all alone and this loser just sits there. I am just surprised that why mother did not gave divorce to him way earlier who made everbody life in the family a misery

I just feel so sad for her. She deserved someone strong by her side. Not this.

1m7qxh9,unsustainable family dynamic (mental health + financial),"my sister (36) has had major mental health issues (huge blowups, arguments, tantrums) for as long as I (30) can remember and while my parents are well intentioned and really doing the best they can (especially as immigrant parents), I really don’t think they’ve been handling it the right way and there’s this constant cycle of resentment, enablement, boiling point, anger, more enablement, rinse and repeat. It’s coming to a head yet again (honestly an annual occurrence at minimum at this point) and I’m really trying to see if I can feel less alone in dealing with this (FWIW I see an awesome therapist, but I feel like I need some semblance of a community that can relate in ways my friends can’t).

Quick background: she’s been in some form of therapy on and off, received various diagnoses, and been on various medications since she was 15. the latest official diagnosis I’m aware of is Bipolar II from a few years ago, but the latest self-diagnosis is the autism spectrum. It’s tough to tell what is really going on here when it’s shifted so much (and I’m in no way trying to be dismissive, there are legitimate mental health issues here it’s just tough to really understand and pinpoint it).

she moved across the country about a decade ago and has not ever been able to truly sustain herself. She’s racked up large credit card debts while neglecting necessary responsibilities and once my parents caught wind of it all, they entered this cycle of perpetually keeping her afloat financially (like literally keeping her checking account out of the negative) and bailing her out anytime there’s an emergency expense. And while there have been periods of time where I can empathize that she wasn’t making much money, she very clearly has an impulsive shopping problem. One example of many is that she’s asked me for money in a panic to pay her electric bill (which I firmly said no to), and then I go visit her a few months later and she has 5+ full-size designer perfumes on her bathroom counter definitely amounting to $1000+. There are clearly deeply irresponsible financial decisions here that are difficult for me to empathize with or excuse.

The last 5 years especially, have been tough. She was alone during COVID and (somewhat understandably considering her loneliness) rushed into a relationship with someone who turned out to be physically and emotionally abusive. She got out of that relationship a little over a year ago and it was extremely traumatic. Since early last year, she’s been fired from 3 jobs in a row due to performance. I was empathetic when she lost the first two, but it’s harder now, I won’t lie. And my parents have provided her a lot of financial support as she was leaving that relationship which I don’t disagree with, but it’s tough to decouple that with the general enablement that was taking place for years prior. To be frank, they wouldn’t have had to financially contribute to help her get out if she (and my parents by enabling her) hadn’t made horrific financial decisions for years prior.

I want nothing more than my parents to finally maintain the boundary of not giving her money anymore - but I, like them, am terrified of the outcome. I want to believe that she can figure her shit out when she’s forced to (she’s smart as hell) - but it’s tough when I haven’t seen the evidence to date. It’s also tough to not feel guilty when I’m upset with her, because I know she wants to be better. I’m just very frustrated at this point.",1,1,1753319474.0,mentalhealth,Beginning-Ad4466,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7qxh9/unsustainable_family_dynamic_mental_health/,2025-07-25T09:58:16.080395

I had a really big long spiral a few months ago, and have been dealing with the aftermath of having that spiral. I am seeing a therapist and have been talking with a nurse practitioner in psychiatry to supervise me through increasing my meds. I’ve been feeling better than I did when I had that spiral, but I am still unable to do certain things due to my anxiety and OCD that I could do before my spiral. I feel very uncomfortable going out of my comfort zone. Now my comfort zone is shrinking I feel, However, I’ve been having lots of highs and lows since the spiral and three months later, I am still feeling sort of mood swings that I’ve never felt before. it’s almost like I’m on my period and I’m just super emotional. Sometimes I am really sad and feel like I’m going through the motions and just overall not enjoying myself in my life and other times I’m super grateful and I just don’t know why I feel this way. It’s all very emotional all the time. I just wanna feel better and I know it’s a process I just wish I knew what was going on and had people to talk to that have me gone through similar things.

I was visiting a classmates home with a guy I was interested in and we had been sexual at this point.

The rest of the night is a blur but it ends up with us at another friends house with a girl who disliked me as well. At the end of the night j refuses to even walk me to the door. I felt so humiliated in front of the other ppl in the car. Years later he followed up by telling me he would never want anything but sex from me. It’s been years and I still replay that night, sometimes changing the scenario where someone rescued me, anyone stood up for me, I feel like I’m ready to blow my brains out.

1m7qtbs,How can I build a support system?,"I have struggled with my mental health all my life - but since I went through a traumatic event in high school and spent most of college dissociating, it has gotten much worse

I am going into my senior year and I’m at my absolute lowest. I’m unhealthy in every aspect and am struggling to take care of myself day to day. I haven’t been able to maintain healthy friendships, and I am not good at reaching out to people or asking for help, so I feel very alone. I recently got into a relationship in which my partner needs a lot of emotional support, and although I like my partner, my mental health has seriously declined since I got into the relationship. I’ve become significantly more insecure and have been spiraling nearly every day. 

I want to create a support system for myself because I want to be emotionally available for my partner and for myself, but I struggle to socialize and I hate myself too much to try and make new friends. I don’t believe I can do anything right and my incompetence is dragging me down. I can’t be vulnerable with anyone in my life and I also don’t know how to maintain a good balance in my friendships/relationships. 

How can I get better at maintaining friendships and how can I create a good support system for myself??

I wanted something that actually made me feel connected, so I ended up building a small app called *Omera* to help myself and others. It has a daily mood tracker, meditation audios, and guided programs, but what really helped me was adding a leaderboard so I could see how my friends and others were doing, too.

1m7qmnv,Everywhere I go I don’t fit in and it’s starting to become unbearable. My mental health is affected.,"From a very young age, I felt unwanted. I was an unplanned pregnancy. My parents stayed together because of me, then my dad cheated and left when I was around three. They reconciled and had three more kids starting when I was four and a half. The focus was always on the new kids or their rocky marriage, never on me. I was “older” and expected to take care of myself. At school, I had behavioral problems because no one taught me how to manage emotions, ask for help, or even that I had needs. At home, I was the maid and caretaker. I was a pretty child, so people assumed I had it easy, but I suffered from depression and anxiety as far back as I can remember.

We moved when I was ten, and I had to start over socially. My siblings were praised for being smart. I was only acknowledged when I was helping someone else, being teased, or told I was pretty, though I thought I was ugly.

Just as I began to find my footing at 11, my parents split. At 12, my mom sent me to live with my dad. I have no memory of it, but apparently, I begged her not to. A year later, she wanted me back. At 15, my dad asked for custody, and I moved again to a third school district.

By then, I was a shell. I tried to fill the void with alcohol and sex. It only made me feel worse. My dad and his girlfriend hated me for it and sent me back to my mom at 16. Despite everything, I graduated early while working three jobs. My dad was gone every other week, and I drove myself to school in a car I bought with my own money. I was in an abusive relationship at the time.

I was kicked out at 18 and tried college. My dad, at his girlfriend’s insistence, made me live in the dorms and take out loans. I was quickly overwhelmed by debt and failed. I asked both parents for help, my mom said no, and my dad eventually said no too. I moved in with a roommate who turned out to be unstable and involved with a gang member. Out of desperation, I joined the military.

The military worsened my mental health, so I left. Afterward, I was again denied housing by both parents. At their request, I moved from rural upstate New York to Los Angeles.

California was overwhelming. I didn’t understand the assumptions people made about me. I held multiple jobs and navigated stigmatized health issues while eventually earning a college degree. Afterward, I worked in the Jewish community but felt out of place, even though I’m Jewish. Because I’m blonde with an unconventional last name, people questioned my identity. I returned to restaurant work, where I’d spent ten years, but was dismissed there too. People called me “white girl” and claimed I didn’t need the job.

Eventually, I re-entered the nonprofit world through another Jewish org but felt alienated again, this time by colleagues who were mostly trust fund kids. I moved out of LA, but when I applied to nonprofits elsewhere, people commented that I wasn’t “from here.” In LA, I landed interviews at racial equity orgs, causes I deeply care about, especially after witnessing white business owners oppress POC in restaurants, but those interviews made me feel like I had to prove I was marginalized too. When I panicked trying to justify my place, I didn’t get the job.

Long story short: I’ve never belonged anywhere. I don’t know what to do. Pls ask questions before jumping to any conclusions.

1m7qebl,"Confused, scared for my gf"," My gf and I are in high school, we live in Houston. She's struggled for 3 years with depression, disordered eating, suicidal ideation, and/or physical self harm. She’s unable to talk to her parents about mental health. She’s asked her mom many times over the past 3 years about any kind of therapy or support, but she has always been told “no”, “we’ll get to it”, or “your boyfriend is good enough”. Her dad has always been very dismissive of any ideas or discussion related to mental health, more so than her mom. Her parents both punish her harshly for having mental health struggles. When they discovered her self harm, they made no effort to support her or provide help for her. They angrily yelled, screamed, and took her phone for some large amount of time. This has supposedly happened multiple times with other things too, but I don’t have any more examples. As a result of this, she sees her family as a dead end for receiving any kind of support. I don’t blame her, I’d feel the same. We've tried text lines, online resources, and techniques and none of it has been able to stand in for the professional support she desperately needs. I have always tried really hard to be present, respectful, loving, and supportive for her, because nobody else really is or has been.
 A few nights ago, her and I were texting and she had an awful experience I'd call some kind of spiraling or breakdown or episode or something but I don’t know enough about anything to know what to call it. She went into much detail about how she feels about her life. Feeling like she’s trapped in a cycle of working up hope to be turned down by her parents, feeling stuck with no way of actually healing until she’s 18 years old and able to try and get herself help. She feels crazy, depressed, alone, and trapped, and I don’t blame her one bit. That night, she wanted to take her life. I would have told somebody, anybody, but my own parents don’t really believe that they treat her quite as badly as she describes to me. I want to do the right thing, and I feel like telling someone should be the right thing, but I feel confused about what to do when “the right course of action” would cause so much pain. I stayed on the phone with her and we called later that night, and she thankfully did not hurt herself that day.
 It’s been a few days since this happened. To my knowledge, she has not felt suicidal since then. Instead, she is now planning to run away to Fort Worth on August 4th. She has a very thorough plan for how to escape, how to survive until she’s 18 in 3 years, and how to avoid getting caught. I'm the only person she trusts enough to talk to about it. I have urged her to talk to more people about this, but she has refused. I feel like doing this is an awful idea. We go to a private school, she lives a relatively privileged life, even if emotionally tumultuous. I feel like it can’t be worth it to throw everything away to go live alone miles and miles away with nothing and nobody. But she seems set in stone about her decision. She believes that she will be able to get herself mental support somehow. She believes that she will be better off and that this is a good idea. She’s described it as “trading everything for hope.” 
I’m just confused. She's contacted 2 text hotlines, and they've both only strengthened the idea by saying ""think about it, nobody can make that decision for you"".

Even as a grown adult, I can't help myself and feel like latching onto a wall and crying so much I'll choke everytime I need a check-up, which I unfortunately end up doing almost everytime. I can't control it, I never could. No matter how many times I've told myself that it's alright, I instantly go panic mode in the clinic.

Recently, I started to notice more things. I know the sound of footsteps of everyone in my family. I even seem to know when somebody is aiming for my door, and not just walking past it. Everytime I know someone will enter I instantly freeze and I feel my heart rate pick up to an uncomfortable speed. I feel lightheaded for a second, my heart hurts from the sudden speed up. But then that someone comes in and it's fine. Like nothing ever happened. But the amount of stress that sinks into me hearing somebody's footsteps is becoming worse and worse every time. 

I have honestly no idea what is happening, but I hope it goes away soon.

1m7fl7f,Feeling lost,"I’m 27 and will be 28 in a few days.
I’ve struggled with my mental health for most of my life - but it’s been good for at least the last 14 months. The last 2 weeks have taken a dramatic turn out of what feels like no where. I hate my body, I hate my job, I hate where I live, I’m trying to buy a house and nothing is affordable at all and renting for life is awful, my relationship is extremely rocky and toxic at times. I don’t see my family as much as I would like, and just feel alone and disdained from the world around me. I’ve never had a problem before with being in the now but find myself constantly zoning out or being in space. I have an appointment to get a new psych and therapist and know that’s. Good step to go forward on. But still just feel lost. 

I tend to feel bad complaining about my life because I know it’s not horrible I have my own apartment, brand new truck, and a high paying job & no mommy or daddies money. I’m grateful for it all and no most are not as privileged to be in my same situation. I just wish my mental health could be stable for once. Anyone else In a similar situation? 

I’ll most likely go on Wellbutrin again it always helps and Ativan for my anxiety. Hoping to get Vyvanse for my weight and eating disorder.

1m7oqr7,I have terrible mental health my brain won’t shut off of wanting to be accepted so darn bad. I’ve been dealing with this my whole life.,"As little as 4 years old I have not been accepted, never had a long term friend, or a like minded community near me. Like never. I’m an only child. The 2 cousins I was close to in my childhood, they moved when I was 10 years old I am now 24. So no siblings, + no friends is so depressing. It has greatly declined my mental health over the years, and I’ve been struggling with it half my life!!!

Still looking for a job, got let go October 2024 I’ve had 5 jobs in all none of em worked out for me. So I’m just a lonely soul sitting at home everyday, watching everyone else life through social media. 

I’m by myself. Nobody to really understand me. I never been understand by a soul growing up. Nobody understood me. I got called weird, slow my whole life especially in high school, middle school. Nobody wanted to be near me. Going through those things at an early age is so damaging because childhood is prime time and one of the most important times of our lives that shapes us into who we become when become adults. Mine’s unfortunately was mentally damaging.

I know the whole thing where you know “you still have time” “it’ll get better” who knows I’m 24 been out of high school 6 years, nothing has gotten better yet. So what’s the likely if not none will it!?

1m7fin1,i never feel like enough,"Lately, it feels like I’m slipping further from the person I thought I’d be. I look in the mirror and just see someone who doesn’t measure up, not attractive, not tall, not confident. I don’t feel like I’m what people expect, and that disconnect makes me want to shrink back into myself. Hide my smile. Hide the way I laugh. Hide everything real about me, because it’s easier than being seen and judged for it.

I’m in India right now, and meeting people I haven’t seen in years is weird. I feel like they expected me to show up as someone better, like a glowed up version of myself, and I didn’t. It’s not like anyone’s directly said it, but it’s in the small looks and offhand comments. About how I look. About how I’ve “changed.” It messes with your head, even if you try not to care.

I’ve been thinking a lot about love and just connection in general. And honestly, it feels like I missed out on a whole chapter of life, being someone people are drawn to, liked for who I am. I see others my age in relationships, having fun, living confidently. I’ve always wanted to feel that. But I don’t think I ever will. It’s this mix of jealousy and sadness that’s hard to shake.

I’m also under a lot of pressure academically, AP tests, expectations, trying to prove something. I don’t want to disappoint anyone, but I feel like I already am. I can’t focus like I used to. My mind is just constantly heavy. And even with friends, it’s different now. I barely talk to most of them anymore, and the ones I do talk to, it’s only at school. I feel like some people I used to be close with just don’t respect me the same anymore. Maybe they never did. I let a lot of stuff slide because I don’t see the point in arguing, but it just builds up. Makes me feel like I’m being looked down on or not taken seriously.

Then there’s this other layer. Being Indian. Being visibly part of a culture that people constantly misrepresent, mock, or stereotype. I’ve heard jokes from people I know that cross the line, and they act like it’s just harmless. But it’s not. It adds to everything else I’m feeling. Like I’m already struggling with my own insecurities, and now I also have to carry the weight of feeling invisible or misunderstood in a world that doesn’t respect where I come from.

There’s this constant loop in my head, feeling like I’m not enough, then hiding more of myself, and then feeling even more disconnected because I’m not being real with anyone. I know I need to love myself. I know I should accept myself.

hi yall. between the half of last year and half of this year I've been in a very deep depressive episode part of my bipolar type 2.
in 2023 I started college (biology bachelor degree) I'm about to graduate next year but I feel like I lost the passion I had for it and my mind is starting to freak out thinking maybe I choose the wrong thing to do.
it used to be my favorite thing of all time. loving science, animals. bugs especially I've always been obssesed with it. I also went to mortuary school but I don't know if I could have it as a career because of my ocd. (I had a few days working with it and everyday I suffered thinking bad stuff like: I'm contaminated I'm gonna catch something Or im gonna bring it home)
so I'm lost. I don't know what to do I don't know if I'm getting my passion for things back.
I dont have passion towards anything so I cant pursue anything even If I decided to have a second degree in something else. I'm lost.
I'm on vacation right now so I'm having time to think. I'm trying to think of something to do after i graduate.

in this business you have to network get to meet people get internships and I do not have the energy to speak to anyone I don't have the energy to get up from bed most days how am I gonna succeed.

that's it I feel lost and my time is running out I need a job I need a career.

My therapist has suggested IOP since I’m a single mom (hence the “sort of suicidal”). Still looking into options but every time I try to explain my situation I feel like a fraud. I’m high-functioning in general and a master at masking.  Am I really that bad or am I just exaggerating? 
I’m serious considering taking Medical Leave for a couple weeks. 

I also work at a corporate office where I do really well but it’s hard for everyone but we have the “if A can do it, why can’t you?” mentality and if you can’t make it, they say that “this job is not for everyone”.

when my psychiatrist started talking to me about it, i just shut down. i don’t know how to accept help or talk about anything like that. we talked about putting me in a mental hospital, of which was going to happen today but didn’t, and although i had shut down and didn’t say or do much of anything i did want to go. i didn’t have the heart to actually say that im truly suicidal because i just couldn’t stomach it all.

my dad doesn’t handle stuff like this well. on the car ride home he asked me if i wanted everyone to give up on me, told me how it’d take a lot of work for me to be in a mental hospital, and other stuff of the sorts all very passive aggressively. my mind has already blocked most of that shit out. he just makes me feel like a problem or an inconvenience for him.

1m7o04z,I feel invisible to every adult in my life,"I’m a 23-year-old girl, and I know this might sound strange, but I wish I had a dad.
I do have a father, and he’s not a bad person, but it feels like I can’t talk to him — like he can’t understand me. When I tell him something important, like “I’m not okay,” he doesn’t know what to say. He just tells me to move on, and I don’t have the strength for that.

I’ve already been in therapy — I’ve seen five therapists and I’m currently in therapy again. The fourth therapist I had was someone I really wanted to continue with, but at some point, the relationship broke and it hurt me deeply. He didn’t understand how important he was to me, and he let me go while I was in pain — a pain that is still here and hasn’t settled.

I want an adult who understands me, who can hold me emotionally, teach me something, and not be scared of me even if I’m sometimes impulsive.
I know it sounds strange, and I know people often say things like “you have to find it within yourself” or “you have to learn to live without it” — but those answers don’t help. I really need this.

There have never been teachers, therapists, or other adults who truly took care of me. At university, I feel invisible.
I feel like I’ve always tried to show adults — the ones I thought might understand — that I was worthy of their attention, that I would listen to them and follow them. Even if I wasn’t always “good,” it still wasn’t enough.

I’m not looking for a partner — I already have a wonderful boyfriend who truly loves me.
What I miss is a safe adult presence, someone I could trust, someone who sees me with kind and steady eyes.
Is there any way to find someone like that? I know it’s probably impossible — I just hope it might not be.

1m7nrmm,When should I get help for hallucinations?,"I am sorry if this post isn’t allowed here.

I have been experiencing very sparse hallucinations since last November. Sparse as in, there have only been five that I know for certain were hallucinations since November. It usually happens when I am really stressed. I was a small business owner and during tough times they would start to happen. I had to close my business, I’m unemployed, and they seem to be coming back.

The hallucinations are usually auditory, sometimes visual. They didn’t start out very scary, but the recent ones have been a little worse. Most common now is the sound of someone sighing or breathing right next to me or in a corner of the room. Back when they were happening more frequently, they would give me strong feelings of anxiety, making it hard to sleep. I don’t feel so anxious right now since I don’t live alone anymore so I’m less paranoid.

I never went to a mental health professional because I didn’t have health insurance before, now I do but I am also unemployed, so seeing someone wouldn’t be the best idea right now.

Is there a point at which I say it’s too much? I just need help navigating this because right now it’s manageable, but I don’t know when enough is enough.

And I guess I don’t know if there is a solution for such sparse hallucinations or if it’s just something I need to manage.

1m7b4qn,Is it possible that I am faking my mental illness?,"Help, I really need help. I don't know if this is me or I am acting the same way an ex situationship used to do. It's been 3 years since we last talked, and I admit that it didn't go well. I invalidated her despite knowing nothing about her condition—which I wish I knew more that time... That's why I look up psychology and different mental health status.

I don't know, honestly, I really have no idea what's happening to me. I've been acting like her diagnosis; I no longer feel the need to eat. My mood swings were terrible and I can't keep a relationship going for more than 3 months. I keep leaving people in bad terms after her... 

What should I do? Is it possible I am faking my behaviors? Any advices, please?

1m7dhzc,What have you named your brain?,"Hi. Neurodiverse here, and for my personal recobery and growth, im learning about the idea of naming my brain and my conditions as a way to drive the DBT / CBT training ive had and the skills inside.. and i was curious if the community had any experiences around this to share, to help me in my decision making stage on names. 

I am looking to pick names for the following parts of me for various reasons, and so if anyone had any suggestions too, I would really love to hear them.

1. Brain. As a whole. So I can tell it off (kindly) when it's being irrational 🫤
2. Autism. Insists on regiment and structure.. it needs to know and plan everything ahead of time.. does anyone know of fictional chars like this?
3... ADHD .. naturally conflicts with the one above. I feel this should be more fae related based on my hyperactivity and impulsiveness 🤭 like were talking picking the kids up from school in an 8ft inflatable unicorn kind of character 
4. Trauma.. this is the one I will be protecting, the side of me that needs time and kindness more than a telling off. But I wish to give it an image of some sorts in my mind so that I can ensure to remember to show myself the kindness I seek to offer myself.
5. Anxiety.. this has presented as a beast or monster most my life (45f), but its the one I tamed first, and now I use anxiety instead of it using me. It's like turning ""distress"" into ""eustress"" .. basically I pushed through the fire and now im on the other side.. so this would welcome a warm beast name, maybe like a pixar movie or a good book reference where at first something was scary, and now it's part of your soul in a good way.

Sorry.. lots there.. but its only been in the last year that I've come to retrust digital communities after being burned hard a long time ago, so im rather scared to be writing this... but I have come to trust reddit communities for their insight, their experiences, their knowledge, their understanding, their kindness and much more..  and so I hope you don't mind that I have asked / written  this post. I am nervous to write this, asking for your opinion or help, but i choose to be brave by trusting the people here won't mind and may have a few things to offer me... I hope 🙏 

Thankyou in advance 
I wish you wellness and happiness

1m7mhm6,Stress management for when you're in a time crunch?,"I (20M) come seeking advice from the masses because I'm currently trying to plan out the month of August, and I'm beginning to realize that this is going to be a really dense month in regards to how many responsibilities I'll have on my plate. 

My roommate and I are moving at the beginning of October, so I'm taking up two gigs to put towards the budget for that in the middle of the month. These gigs are back-to-back, and the total amount of time it will take to complete them both is roughly a week and a half.

I'll also be in school part-time. I have to finish a two-week tutoring program, and then I'll be starting fall semester classes while I work at my main job.

I have a weekly meeting at my youth group in the evenings as well that I attend consistently to be updated on what's happening in my community.

I'm not amazing when it comes to stress management, just based on me having an anxiety disorder and being terrible at feeling my feelings, so I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to keep myself sane throughout August with as little burnout as possible. I never really learned how to adequately deal with this kind of stress before, so I've driven myself to exhaustion more than once.

I can feel anxiety and dread about big events but rather than having a clear picture of feeling it’s as if it’s several rooms back behind a closed door muffled drowning out. 


Idk if this is anything real or if it’s just the way I am or if it’s a self fulfilling prophecy due to me being overly self aware, but does anyone relate to this. Again, I’m not depressed.

1m7m1m2,My boyfriends sister has been SH,"Last Sunday (so about 4 days ago) I was hanging out with my boyfriend. We were in the car with his mom, stepdad, and his 11 year old sister when I noticed she had small cuts (likely done with a razor blade from a pencil sharpener) from her wrist up to her elbow. She probably had at least 20 cuts or so. Later that night when me and my boyfriend were alone I asked him about it. He told me that they had started roughly a month ago when they went to Arizona. For a little bit of context his parents divorced a year or so ago and last December his mom, sister and him moved to Utah. They went to Arizona to visit their dad and friends but my boyfriend said that his sister didn't hang out with her friends at all while they were there. He also said that she hasn't face timed them recently either so its likely a friend related issue. When they first moved to Utah they just stayed in a rental house till the end of May and then moved again into a house that they had actually bought so she doesn't have any friends near by in Utah at the moment. Now to why I'm on here. What should we do? Me and her aren't super close or anything but we get along. Their mom knows and has taken away her razor blades but what else can we do to help her. Should I talk to her about it? Should my boyfriend? My boyfriend is really worried about her and its started to take a toll on him as well. We just don't know what to do or how to help her.

1m7g3k6,Am I crazy?? Is this normal?!,"Okay sooo I’m 15F and well I’m kind of worried about something.

I have certains hallucinations I guess? Now they might be completely normal but it is worth asking.

Additional infos : I am diagnosed with asd level 1 and mild dyspraxia. I have a lot of other symptoms that hint to potential mental health issues.

* Okay so first we got the noise hallucinations. Those hallucinations are mostly stuff like hearing someone calling my name when I’m completely alone, hearing footsteps, hearing whispers…. A bunch of creepy sounds that truly make me feel really scared at times.
* Visual hallucinations : Well just a few minutes ago I was sitting on the couch going through TikTok, when I saw something kinda human shaped moving in the corner of my eye, my heart jumped and I turned my head to see if someone was there but there was nothing. Just the jacket of my father on a chair. Turned my attention back to my phone, jumping on reddit because it reminded me to talk about the hallucinations and then suddenly I SAW IT AGAIN. It was clearly something or someone moving. At least thats what I saw. Well this phenomenon had happened to me quite often, most of the time with shadows at night, and it makes me freak out truly.
* Physical hallucinations: Simple thing, little taps or grazing against my skin, despite being alone. And also feeling my phone vibrates when it didnt.
* Smell hallucinations: For example : smelling gaz, or something burning, then going to ask someone else about it and them telling me theres absolutely no smell. Sometimes I also get pleasant smells such as coffee.

Why didn’t I talk about it earlier even if its been happening for a while now ? Well pretty simple. I believe in ghosts. Like completely. So I assumed that the shadows, the physical and the noises could be explained by the presence of a spirit. And the smells? Assumed it was some sort of smell memory that randomly activated itself.

Now, I randomly fell on a post a few days ago that explained the exact same symptoms…. But it was someone saying that it was related to their BPD. 

And considering I have other symptoms, I just wanted to ask if those things are normal or potentially related to anything.

Now i am cornered not knowing if im mentally too weak for all of life’s stimuli or maybe a brain imbalance.

1m7fr4d,My M24 mental health is so bad I struggle to see or be positive about anything.," This is going to be a long post sorry in advance. So when I was around 4 years old, we had a family friend whose son would sexually assault me. I carry some guilt about this because if I would have said something sooner, my cousin and my friend from school wouldn’t have been sexually assaulted too, but he would threaten Me and my family. This happened for a few years before I told my dad. Because of this I felt like I grew up too fast and I didn’t relate to the other kids around me. Not saying I didn’t have friends I did but I just felt out of place. This is just one thing that made me have a negative view of the world. In high school I had one girlfriend who I was dating for 6 months, now I struggle with physical intimacy because I have trust issues so I never did anything with her physically. During the summer she went to North Dakota to see her grand parents who lived there while I stayed home and worked a night shift cleaning a movie theatre. When she came back she asked me to go to a party, where she cheated on me with her ex and sent me snaps with her ex. Fast forward to my next relationship we met on a dating app and it turned out she went to my high school but a grade lower, we started taking and I really liked her we talked about our lives and we’re very open and up front about our past. We started dating and she did care about my past and would make me feel better just by being there. Well she ended up leaving me, we did have issues and fights but also some good times. She said it’s because I’m not emotionally mature and financially stable for her right now. I don’t blame her but it left me in a bit of a dark place she was someone who made me feel safe and whom I trusted, and yes to the point where I was able to be physically intimate with her. We would still talk a lot after we separated and I still love her but I feel as though she doesn’t love me anymore mainly because she has said sometimes she does but she tells herself not to. I also work in EMS and have seen so much trauma, I have seen people die in horrible ways. I have had to tell family members that their loved ones were gone and see them break down. Now I worked this job because I want to help people, I know what it feels like to be so low and feel like you have no one so I want to be there for them so they don’t feel like they’re alone. Now I have been in a deep depression lately and my recent ex said that maybe we should go no contact and I was really down so I said, “by the time you get back from your trip I’ll be gone so I want to say farewell now, I hope you kick ass in school, you have the life you dream of, I’m sorry I couldn’t be the one to do that with you. Good bye”. And she got worried that I would be gone gone. And said to me “if it’s keeping you here talk to me I’m sorry I wouldn’t listen to you before but I’ll try now” because she used to be good but then with the fights and mistakes I made she struggled to be that way. when I would try to talk to her about my issues I felt like she took it and turned it into an argument and then I felt like shit because it always turned sour. I just want people to understand me and be there for me I don’t want to fight this alone anymore, I don’t want to go through life alone any more. It’s hard because if she was like that near the end of our relationship, I can’t help but think maybe we would still be together.

1m7fh74,"Asked for a referral to a Psychiatrist, got a call to schedule with a Social Worker instead…","I don’t know what to do next. I’ve tried three different clinics to get access to a psychiatrist, ended up with a Nurse Practitioner twice- neither willing to do anything more than prescribe meds (that my primary care had already prescribed.) I see a therapist already and am on meds, but I’ve been plateaued in my mental health improvement for a while, and also noticed small declines. I could feel a breakdown coming and so I went to my PCP saying I am functional but I’m not getting better since the last medication bump where they doubled my dose. My care plan has consisted of the same medication with slight dosage increases for 4 years. I did improve in the beginning and am much happier but I also would like more specific help and answers that my current care team is unable to provide. I thought I was given a referral to a Psychiatrist like I requested. My PCP even warned me it may be a while because she is on maternity leave and has a waitlist. I said that’s fine because I still have my care team to keep me functional in the meantime. I got a call today to schedule and was very confused because it’s only been a month. They wanted to schedule me with someone else so I asked what her qualifications were- (cause I didn’t want to end up seeing another NP) and she’s a social worker. I told them I already have a therapist and that is not what I need. I’m just disappointed. It feels like an actual psychiatrist would require being part of some secret society. I’m tired.

I know that means I’m at least average. I’ve had a few strangers compliment me but I guarantee it was on their bucket list and they had to cross off “tell an ugly girl she’s pretty so you both feel good”, one time in an alternative school last year (I now go to a normal high school after getting my grades up) a few girls called me pretty but I don’t believe it. It was a tight knit school so I think they were just trying to be nice to outsiders.  Either way, I’m fat so that already tanks how attractive I am. 

I remember hearing something about how kids interact with you it lets you know you’re ugly? I think? I volunteered at a woman’s shelter yesterday and one of the toddlers kept staring at me. Actually all the toddlers and babies stared at me while I was handing out food. A fee days ago a baby laughed after looking at me as well and was like smiling at me. Did the baby laughed after looking because I was so atrocious it felt like it had to? Was I scaring the toddlers because of how ugly I am? I can’t even look at the mirror without feeling so so disgusting.

I’ve had a few boyfriends but they’ve never lasted long, I either broke it off or they did because I wasn’t talking to them enough. I don’t get why they would date me if I’m this embarrassing to look at. I’m practically obese. My foster mom says I’m at a pretty healthy weight, maybe not “the weight I want to be at but still healthy” to be exact. Which I don’t get. I’m 150 at 5’3??? That is way overweight. especially in high school.

1m7kyrg,Do you have a stress disorder?,"I recently decided that my depression like symptoms from the last two years were not caused by grief, low self-esteem, or other common mental health stressors. I went on to a search and figured out that the root cause can come from disorders in the body. This is what I found:

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excess cortisol, known as hypercortisolism, can result from several different conditions and mechanisms. Here's an overview of the main causes:

**Cushing's Syndrome** This is the umbrella term for any condition causing prolonged exposure to high cortisol levels. It can be caused by:

* **Pituitary adenomas** (Cushing's disease): Benign tumors in the pituitary gland that secrete excess ACTH, which then stimulates the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol. This accounts for about 80% of Cushing's syndrome cases.
* **Adrenal tumors**: Both benign (adenomas) and malignant (carcinomas) tumors of the adrenal glands can directly produce excess cortisol, independent of pituitary control.
* **Ectopic ACTH syndrome**: Non-pituitary tumors elsewhere in the body (commonly lung, pancreatic, or thyroid cancers) secrete ACTH, leading to excessive cortisol production.

**Medication-Related Causes** Long-term use of corticosteroid medications (like prednisone, hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone) for conditions such as asthma, arthritis, or inflammatory disorders can suppress the body's natural cortisol regulation and create a state similar to Cushing's syndrome.

**Stress and Lifestyle Factors** Chronic psychological stress, severe depression, alcoholism, and intense physical stress can lead to persistently elevated cortisol levels, though typically not as extreme as in Cushing's syndrome.

**Pseudo-Cushing's States** Certain conditions like severe depression, chronic alcoholism, or poorly controlled diabetes can mimic Cushing's syndrome by causing elevated cortisol levels without an underlying tumor or glandular problem.

The symptoms of excess cortisol typically include weight gain (especially around the midsection and upper back), purple stretch marks, easy bruising, muscle weakness, high blood pressure, diabetes, mood changes, and characteristic facial changes. Proper diagnosis usually requires specialized hormone testing and often imaging studies to identify the underlying cause.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my case it turns out that my body generates lots of stress and that it depletes my Vitamin C and likely my magnesium which are both needed to manage stress and cortisol production. I have since been taking lots of Vitamin C each day and it has really helped me recover my old energy. I'm not quite back 100% but it has made a huge difference and I wanted to share because I am sure there are others out there that can relate.

1m7knsb,"Skypiatrist ghosted my partner right when his disability paperwork was due — now he’s screwed, no income at all. Anyone? Luigi?","My partner was using Skypiatrist ""tele-health"" for psychiatric care and had a doctor who agreed to handle his disability leave paperwork. It was rocky right from the get-go — he took forever to file basic paperwork, charged hundreds of dollars to do the simplest things and on top of it, would fuck up the basic forms — like put HIS name in the PATIENT blank — so they would all have to be done all over again! 

It was annoying, but whatever. Then…. A year went by and it came for him to resubmit the paperwork again. It seemed like everything was on track — his slow, slow track —  until the deadline approached to file it…. He kept saying he would do it…..and then finally, the week the paperwork was due, and the doctor just… disappeared. No cancellation, no message, no explanation. Just vanished.

The deadline passed. No paperwork filed. No benefits, no reimbursement. No income at all.

A few days later, the doctor sent a vague one-line message saying he was “in the hospital.” That’s it. No apology, no info, no follow-up. And Skypiatrist? Completely ghosted us. We’ve left multiple voicemails and messages — not one has been returned. Nothing but silence.

We even went to their supposed Brooklyn office — the address on Wythe Avenue? Vacant**.** And the Skypiatrist main number — (844) 384‑2779 — sounds a lot more like a Mumbai call center than Brooklyn.

It’s now been weeks — months. No one has helped. No one has taken responsibility. My partner’s been completely screwed over by a company that clearly doesn’t give a shit about its patients — about continuity of care, the urgent importance of things like employment paperwork and deadlines. They can’t even return a phone call. This is legit medical abandonment.

Anyone else dealt with Skypiatrist? Any ideas? Legal angle? Public shaming? Media? Pissed and ready to escalate.

I’m scared, confused, and ashamed. I haven’t told anyone. I keep wondering if it’s my fault, if I provoke it somehow. But… I don’t think love is supposed to feel like this.

1m7ej88,"Feeling empty after dreaming too high, ideal destroyed me.","
Dream for me is the best version of myself, and ideal is my own conciousness creating a method to reach it. Both can be seen as one, as such sometimes one can perceived ideal as dream. 

I dream of becoming an artist(a comic book artist to be exact), what is the method then? What is the ideal created by my own mind?, i bought an online course, buy equipment and all. Watching people drawing, i am obsessed with the idea of becoming an artist. 

Now this is where my struggle begins, my mind imposed my ideal that ""to become a great artist, you must attend the number one art univ"". This is where the spiral begins, note: in my country you need to take national exam alongside presenting portfolio to register on a univ. I tried once, still thinking positive but then in the second try i begin to hate it.

I hate how many people cheat on the national exam, i hate how there is a topic in one of the categories in the exam is included that isnt even relevant to begin with (yeah it was literacy exam but you got asked about physics, like wtf) without notice and the last one is i hate how i think maybe i am not good enough.

Then i fail again. I begin to compare my portfolio and grades with other people who passed. Then i realized how big the gap between me and them, they are from big cities they can attend an offline course since they are little, also they have better creative minds.

I begin to ask myself? Should i continue trying to become an artist?. I am now accepted into other art univ (less prestigious but overall still a good uni if you ask me),I feel like taking a shortcut because this new uni is much easier to apply. but even then...now i feel empty. Anything that once bring joy to me now feels stale, games,anime, even drawing itself.

1m7kgyx,Feeling stuck in a limbo,"I've been reflecting on my life now that I'm in mid-thirties: I've hit a point where I feel the need for a significant change, but I'm not sure where to start. I'm hoping to get some external perspectives.

**-** Work: I have a stable, well-paying job in tech, in the R&D of a scale up, that allows me to live comfortably. However, it gives me little satisfaction these days. I feel isolated, my team isn't very ambitious although I respect and like them, and the lack of real pressure means I feel my skills are not growing as much they used to.

\- Social life: I'm single and have very few friends, whom I see rarely. I've been living in a different country for almost a decade, but the friendships I built over the years disappeared one by one either because these people moved to different countries or we just didn't keep in touch, especially after the covid era. Most of my daily interactions are now with colleagues, but these are superficial relationships. They are nice people, but they have their own lives, and don't seem to be interested in building any significant friendships. 

\- Personal life and hobbies: My hobbies (like calisthenics, kayaking, neural networks, programming, and other things) have taken a backseat because my low mood drains all my energy. I'm struggling a bit with social anxiety, which gets worse when I compare myself to peers who are building their own families at this stage of life. The summer holidays are hitting me particularly hard because I have no one to spend them with.

1m7e3ou,"Tired of this, need support","I just need someone to listen to me, maybe advice, anything, I’m trying to figure out what to do. Sorry if this is the wrong spot or too long

I know some of it is on me too but the way they chose to punish me harmed me in so many ways that I genuinely have been suffering because of it

I don’t care how stupid it sounds but genuinely no adult in my family understands nor cares how awful it is to be a teenager (which I am currently) that’s constantly disrespected even at the littlest things and blamed, and guilt tripped for stupid things and not being able to do anything or even defend myself because I’m still a child and they get to be protected and have each others back because their my parent or elder, and if I talk back to far i get punished of course sometimes physical but for my own good I protect my self and not take it to far.

In middle school (11 - 13 mostly) I had trouble with waking up in the morning. This caused a lot of arguments and got physical at times. I tried so hard to express that it felt like I was weighted down or stuck and it felt impossible, maybe from a mental health issue, she’d say she listened but as soon as I made her mad again she seemed to forget about it all and went back to doing a multitude of things that greatly affected my mental health serverely as I was also very sensitive to what my parents said to me specifically.

The worst incident that happened was one time when I got up and went to the bathroom and I was trying to put my clothes on but I started to feel stuck again. I immediately started to feel scared because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to do it on time which then kept me frozen for longer. When she came back to check on me, she got so furious to the point were she unlocked the door to be being barely dressed and starting hitting me and yelling at me while I was stuck in a corner powerless. I cried so hard I could barely breathe, everything was so loud, my heart was racing, I was sweating and scared in the uncomfortable position I was in, and barely could beg her to stop because I couldn’t catch my breath,

I had never felt so scared and powerless like that before and it drove me into such a bad mental state

Around that time I fell into a depression where my emotions felt numb, nothing felt real, I was miserable, I realized I couldn’t feel empathetic to people anymoreI started SHing but stopped myself before it got to bad.
Thankfully I have found a better mental state and broke free from the depression mostly, and I say mostly because some of the effects such as not knowing what emotion I’m feeling anymore (if it’s not overpowering) and loss of genuine empathy to feel how anthor person feels like I used to be able to.

I just don’t know exactly how to take this, I kinda want to go to the therapist but I don’t know how to.

1m7k04u,I did not cry since a long time,"Hello there from Germany!

My English is not so great, but I hope you can understand me.

A while ago was the 5th anniversary of the death of my (m, mid 30, single, maybe relevant) parents. A good friend of mine visited yesterday, we joked, gamed, talked. 

He suddenly stated that it would be ok if I cried. I found it strange and asked him about it. 
I realise while we talked that I cried a lot as small kid, but it stopped and neither of us could remember that I ever cried again. 

The burial, the splitting of the inheritance, other calls, bills and bank, and termination of the lease/emptying out the apartment was organised by me, the jungest of 3. Meanwhile my Siblings and others from my family were overwhelmed with grief. I did not cry even once there. My friend said it was not normal.

I also have to say, nothing really bad happened to me otherwise. My Parents and Siblings were/are all fantastic. When it comes to friends, I have a few and still talk with them, but I never had a big friend group like my siblings. We just grow distant because I withdraw a bit. But even when i look calm, I am a bit restless, but I never thought anything of it until now. 

In the last 15 years, I moved every 1 to 3 years and moved 4 states in that time. I am close to moving again, near my current employer of 2 years (one way is around 80 km or 50 miles). 

I normally trust my friends instinct and now questioning myself: is it still somewhat normal or should I seek out someone on that topic? I currently feel a bit strange and conflicted, which is unusual for me.

He went to watch a movie, came back to follow an actress of that movie, liked some posts but I kind of figured it out that it's my insecurity and not his, also when my discomfort with him liking the posts was visible he said he wouldn't do that, I said I can manage and I should be more understanding, he said that I am already very understanding and he likes me more than anyone so this isn't a big task.

Now, he treats me with respect and is super gentle with me. He tries to act like sigma but he cried once when he was drunk when I said that I was sure he would hurt me. He's also obsessed with me sexually idk if that's a good thing though. He made me meet all his friends. We are long distance and he keeps video calling me whenever he thinks he saw something I would like, even with his friends. He also calls me whenever he's super drunk. 

See I still think anyone can hurt me in future, I really don't know if he's a red or green flag. But due to my past I am always very anxious when it comes to relationships. I want to be better in this aspect so that even if he chooses to hurt me, I am okay and I don't fuck up my brain and career with overthinking this rn.

I know it's pretty long and I am very young. Please suggest me ways with which I can love myself more and not just be dependent on his actions. Also I have a question, does being hyper vigilant in a relationship protects from getting hurt? Also if I stop being afraid of him cheating, will this help  our relationship in a good way and I will also stop seeing these small things that are happening?

1m7d68l,Navigating past my first Anxiety Attack- OCD/General Anxiety help,"Hi everyone, I am a 22F with diagnosed ADHD- following up this friday afternoon on OCD evaluation testing. While I’ve always been anxious and a bit tightly wound, my quirks have always seemed like regular personality traits to me rather than something reflecting OCD or another diagnosis. I have always been immersed in my mental health and understanding my brain and emotions, and have mostly attributed most quirks to generalized anxiety. Once I received my ADHD diagnosis, I felt content in pausing my mental health exploration for the time being and instead just understanding my ADHD. 

However, I had an odd and unsuspecting trigger this weekend that makes me reconsider. 

I am a John Green fan and when I saw “Turtles All The Way Down” available to stream at home, I instantly began watching (without knowing the plot). I enjoyed the movie, (what i was able to finish) but found that I heavily reflected the same internal dialogue as the main character…. like… spot on. I do not express the bacteria fears she does, but it genuinely scared me how accurate her internal dialogue, questioning, anxiety, etc. all reflect my own. I literally said “it’s like he’s taking the script directly from my brain when she’s overthinking”. 

Remaining calm, I continued to watch the film. With 15 minutes left, I found myself sobbing and inconsolable. I related so much to the movie that I got so overwhelmed and had my first ever anxiety/panic attack (i’m still unsure). long story short- it lasted about 45 minutes or so. I am someone who’s open with my emotions, it’s not unusual for me to cry a few crocodile tears haha, but never truly sobbing. I accidentally woke my partner up from crying so loud. When we sat down after the fact and discussed it, he told me i was crying so hard that he thought a family member died… that’s not like me. I was truly inconsolable. It was an odd feeling of feeling overwhelmed, yet understood, and tbh a little bit of sadness to have related to a movie about mental struggle soooo strongly. I feel understood, yet totally lost at the same time. 

And, honestly, embarrassed that a movie is what triggered me. 

It was just a bit eye opening to see that everyone else doesn’t overthink as much as I do, and I’m the one who’s doing too much, now idk where to begin. It was kinda like a “wait- not everyone does this????” 
I understand she has generalized anxiety as well in the film, which is minorly reassuring to me. 

I am not trying to diagnose myself just because i related to a movie, and not just because I had an anxiety attack- but they’re definitely alleys I need to investigate. 

If you’ve ever had a moment where a story shattered your perception of ‘normal’—how did you process that? Did it shift how you saw yourself?
If you’ve watched the movie, do you relate- or do you find it to be dramatic or more so reflecting anxiety

I am just looking for direction- kinda trying to understand and articulate my feelings about this before I snowball into something else when I speak to my mental health professional this Friday.

1m7j47c,I’m worried about my partner.,"Hi. I’m (31 F) seeking some advice regarding my partner (34 F). I’m worried about them. 

To give some context we recently moved back to our home town after living in Cali for 2 years. We’ve been back home now for 6 months. Trying to rebuild again, save up and get rid of our debt. 

We’re both tattoo artists, but things have been so slow to where we both had to get 9-5 jobs. 

I thought this would help with stress and feeling anxious, at least with finances. Even though we have to get up at 7am almost every morning and not being done some days till 8pm. I understand that’s just how life is now and you gotta do what you can. 
I felt that there was some progress with having a routine again and making money. 

But I’m starting to wonder if it’s unhealthy, especially for my partner. They come home exhausted to where they fall asleep for 2-3 hours. And by the time they wake up, we have to get ready for bed and start the day all over again. Because of this they don’t have time to eat or to properly take care of themselves. 

They’re in constant pain almost everyday because they’re always on their feet and also suffer from CPTSD. They have been doing therapy and taking their medication, but there has been complications with the insurance to where they had to stop. 

I’m trying to be there for them as best as I can. I try helping by cooking and staying on top of things in our apartment. I try to have patience and not put too much stress on them, but sometimes I find myself being overwhelmed and not sure what else I could do to help. 

I have also thought about talking with them and advising to maybe go be with family for a little bit in Mexico. Maybe use that time to think about what they want to do and what would bring them both peace and happiness. Possibly even explore other tattoo career paths out of state. However that would possibly mean being long distance or breaking up. We have taken a break before, so I’m not sure if that’s even an option at this point. I don’t want to stress them out or be triggered. I just want them to be happy. 

It worries me with how stressed out they’ve been to where they feel like they’re in a corner and not knowing what to do. 

Please, I would appreciate any advice. ",1,1,1753299888.0,mentalhealth,AdFront3230,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7j47c/im_worried_about_my_partner/,2025-07-25T09:58:17.278201

1m7ifr1,I’m feeling numb and I don’t know what to do,"I (17f) have been feeling like I’ve got absolutely nothing to look forward to anymore. My neighbours horse (who I have looked after for 3 years and known since I was 4) passed away on my birthday a couple weeks ago, and since then it just feels like I’m in a limbo. My driving lessons keep getting cancelled or held back, the job I was going for doesn’t have any availability, this month has just been grating in so many tiny ways, making me feel progressively worse. It seems so stupid to be affected by the literal definition of first world problems, because I have a good family, I live in a nice house and I have a good life.

1m7ifjo,"I want to help my bestfriend,i don’t want to lose him","Hi, a friend of mine recently lost his cousin (he was like his best friend), his cousin took his own life by shooting himself with his father's gun, I would like to help him but I don't know how, my friend had already started smoking recently and was recently recovering from a period of depression due to the rejection of his best friend, my friend has always gone through periods of depression since I've known him but now he's different from other times, he doesn't answer messages and calls and only makes stories about his cousin, now he just texted me that tomorrow at the funeral (I asked him to come down to distract himself), what scares me is that he lives at home only with his mother (which is the reason for his problems with women, not because she hurt him, but because he is a lonely person and by isolating himself he ends up isolating himself even more, and many times it seems like she doesn't care about what her son does), is that he has always had self-destructive tendencies, I have no proof but I'm sure that in the past he also cut himself.
He tends to isolate himself and push us away during these times, but I want to help him, I really want to but I don't know how. My other best friend and I will be visiting him soon.

This is a copy of his last story:
“Today, I found strength in seeing you for the last time, or at least in seeing your body, because I feel your soul every day. How beautiful you are, but how awful it was to have that realization that you'd lost the only pillar that could truly hold you up. But despite that, seeing you without a smile, without saying goodbye, finally made me cry so much. Somehow, I pushed away that part of the pain that needed to go away. To my twin”.

1m7iarz,Friend ghosted me after leaving me alone on my birthday. I’m really sad,"TW: SA

I’m 24. I had a close friend I really cared about. We talked all the time and were very supportive of each other.

About 10 months ago, I made an anonymous post warning women about a man who sexually assaulted me. I didn’t name myself, but I told her privately. She was supportive.

8 months later, she started dating a man in his late 40s (we’re both in our 20s). He’s best friends with the man who assaulted me. She knew that. She also told me he used ice, was emotionally unstable, and wanted her to quit her job to spend more time with him. I brought up concerns because I cared.

6 weeks ago, it was my birthday. She suggested we take a trip to celebrate. While we were out to dinner, she stepped outside to take a call from her boyfriend. She didn’t come back for over an hour. I was left sitting alone at the table. She only returned because the restaurant was closing. I had to pay for both meals because she never came back inside.

I was upset. I’d had a few drinks and told her how I felt. I said her boyfriend was gross. He knew it was my birthday and still took her away to argue. I asked what she was getting from this. She’s young and independent, and he’s unstable and trying to control her. I also said his best friend sexually assaulted me and he still chooses to be close to him.

She told me I wasn’t being a good friend and left again to talk to him. I apologized before she left. I just wanted her to understand how hurt I felt.

I stayed out all night alone in a city I didn’t know and walked 3km home at 5am.

After that, she didn’t ghost me immediately, but she was distant. We had a trip planned for early July. I booked flights two months ahead. A week before, she canceled to stay with him. I lost $1200.

A week later, a new anonymous comment appeared on my SA post. It defended the guy, saying he was great to date. It felt like someone trying to discredit me. Other women had also shared their experiences, so the comment stood out.

She had told me before that he found out I wrote it and wanted it removed. She didn’t directly ask, but it felt like pressure. I refused.

So I called her out, saying the timing of the comment felt too convenient. She didn’t deny it, just said maybe it was someone else.

Three weeks ago, I asked if she wanted to catch up. She never responded. I haven’t heard from her since.

Am I wrong for how I reacted? Or was I just standing up for myself?",1,1,1753298046.0,mentalhealth,Right-Impression6722,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7iarz/friend_ghosted_me_after_leaving_me_alone_on_my/,2025-07-25T09:58:17.278201
1m7iank,How to support my Roommate,"Hello, since September my Roommate (F19) and I (F19) have been sharing a dorm. She's a lovely and mostly cheerful person and for the longest time I haven't suspected her to have any sort of mental health issues. I started noticing things after our next door neighbours got into a verbal fight and got quite loud and angry. She excused herself and was gone for about half an hour until I had to go into our shared room. I found her curled up on the bed crying her eyes out. For a second I didn't even notice it because she was so silent. She made no noise, no sniffling or blowing nose. She was dead silent, I couldn't even hear her breathe. I asked if she was okay and she nodded. I didn't press because what should I even ask her? She's a private sort of person and I didn't want to pressure her. After that I started noticing that she's very sensitive to sound and anger. She flinched when people raise their voices even to speak in crowds. She does it in a subtle way that I didn't catch before. I've also seen her cry when somebody shut the doors real loud and one time when some girl was yelling at her bf in the hall, she was starting to tense up and I figured she'd cry and wanted to maybe reassure her that she was safe but she bent over and threw up. She apologised to me almost immediately and started cleaning (I helped her of course) but I was just very worried about her.

She doesn't have any contact with her immediate family, never talks about them, she lives with her aunt for the summer but that's all I know. I wish to support her better but I don't know how? She never rants or vents. I know she takes some meds for anxiety.

1m78rpn,I will never be loved,"I try my best to be a great partner to my girlfriend. I have even been complimented by her family and friends. I love seeing her happy. Regardless, all she says about me is ""I wish he was taller"" (I am significantly taller but definitely not 6ft though).

This eventually destroyed my confidence and sent me down a rabbit hole. I don't like what I found out. Saying women are obsessed with tall guys is an understatement. I've seemingly never met women who didn't care about height, probably because they don't exist. Guys twice your height are the new accessories. If you are tall you can be a horrible partner, and you will be forgiven, while short guys get dumped for breathing wrongly. Every happy couple I know includes a tall guy.

I am not shallow myself, and I am surprised at how many women want an impractical height difference. Wanting someone taller is normal, but why 6ft? Why *that* much taller? And why is this so universal? I don't get it.

It is a grim thought that I will never be loved like a tall guy. No one will appreciate me the way I do for them. I won't get the unconditional support or the positivity or celebration that tall guys get. I am more of an appliance than a partner. I will be settled for until someone better comes. Tall guys are ""perfection"", and I can never be perfect since I can't grow.

I have basically dug a hole for myself. I have lost interest in my current relationship as it is not what I imagined. I can of course find partners, but my height (5'6) alone has erased any hope of me actually being loved.

1m7hj31,Can't get rid of self-hate (23M),"Every day I wake up thinking why am I still alive, and every night I sleep with tears thinking why am I so bad. On paper, I have everything good enough to be happy: I have a job that aligns with my interest, I have my parents who love me and talk to me daily, I have many friends who care about me. Even I feel okay when I am around people or I am socializing. I laugh, I have fun, I go on outings. But the second I'm alone, I just feel like disappearing out from this world, thinking that no one ever actually cares about my existence. I hate my body, I hate my skills, I hate how I talk to people, I hate that I have never been in a relationship because I don't know how to express love. 

I have never told anyone about these thoughts. I just try calling and talking to people, trying my best to act normal. I'm afraid of people thinking I'm crazy. No one likes a sad or depressed person. I don't believe in therapists because I feel like they just want you to keep you under their medication so that they keep earning. 

I just have these dreams thinking that one day I will work hard to get what I wanted, but then I look at my reality and cry.

1m7b7sl,How to respond to my friends sending pics of/ talking about their SH,"So I actually have two friends who do sh. Both are really close to me and will sometimes (at least once a week) talk to me about how they did sh or send me pics. Now I always try to let them know I'm there for for them but I'm not always sure how to respond. We're all 19.


Friend A- She sometimes vents to me about her mental health and SH but doesn't like replies like ""Hey bro I'm there for you."" Or ""You can talk to me if u want to, I'm listening."" She will just say whatever she wants to say and when I reply she ignores my reply or says nah don't say stuff like that. I understand she might be pushing me away because she's really hurt. But uhh do I just say my part everytime she comes and dumps info? She also sends me pics and says it doesn't even hurt anymore and that she enjoys doing it.( Ik that's actually not the case.) I try to let her know subtly that I will be always there for her since she actually cringes when I say it directly. For example when I  say something like ""Bro that sounds shitty. I'm here so u can talk if you want. Or I can come over and  just sit with u"" She sends laughing emojis and says something like lmaoo or stop. Idk if I'm doing it right. She can't afford professional help. How do I reply for her to not cringe or stop me.


Friend B has a very toxic environment at home. She does SH and will talk to me about it and sometime sends pics (Friend A is more likely to send pics). One time she showed me her pic and I kinda got triggered because I was actually very depressed at that time. But I still let her know I was there for her over text. But I didn't really bring the topic ( about her doing SH) up irl because I thought I should let her bring up instead of asking her directly. But she misunderstood and thought I got grossed out by her. We had a friendship breakup almost but then I talked to her and she realized it was huge misunderstanding. Maybe at that time her mental health was clouding her judgement. So this friend doesn't mind me showing concern and comfort. But I'm not sure what I should say when she sends pics or describes what she did. Ik me just saying stuff isn't gonna solve her problem but how can I help her more efficiently.",2,3,1753281995.0,mentalhealth,SilentAd9145,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7b7sl/how_to_respond_to_my_friends_sending_pics_of/,2025-07-25T09:58:17.278201

1m7h1nj,Is this puberty or something,"Hey everyone,
I 15F been having some really strange experiences when it’s dark. I keep seeing figures—dark shapes—that walk or run toward me on repeat. Sometimes they come really close, and it scares me. Other times, when I open my eyes, it feels like one of them is right next to me, and I get jump scared. This only happens in the dark, not during the day.

It started a while ago with small objects turning into figures walking toward me, but now it feels like everything around me is moving or changing shape(in the dark only) Sometimes I see little dots or shapes that aren’t really there, and they happen a lot.

One night, when it was hot and I couldn’t sleep in my room because there were mosquitos biting me, I went downstairs to sleep on the couch. It wasn’t dark enough, so I kept seeing things—dots, figures—and at one point, it felt like four figures were standing next to each other looking at me. I turned the lights on, but everything still looked weird. Chairs seemed to move and turn toward me, pillows looked like they were breathing or moving closer, and shadows formed shapes that felt alive. Near the curtain, there was a shadow that looked like a baby figure walking toward me over and over. I even whispered for it to stop coming closer. At one point, it wouldn’t stop walking towards me and I got so scared I started crying, which I don’t usually do. Also the room just looked weird in general, I looked weird too, I felt like a video game character 

Since then, I haven’t seen anything like that baby figure again, but the other figures and moving shapes still happen when it’s dark.

I don’t use weed often, and I believe these things started before I even started smoking. I don’t have anxiety, and I sleep okay, but these visions keep happening.

I honestly think it’s nothing much, because it doesn’t really bother me THAT much since it only happens in the dark but it has definitely gotten worse 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? What could be causing it, and how do you deal with it? Any advice or shared experience would really help.

1m710ce,Completely stuck in life,"I am 19M (less than 2 months away from turning 20) and feel completely stuck and behind in life. 

This is a long one so buckle in. 

I can’t get a job, I can’t get a girlfriend, I can’t get the only 2 friends I have to do cool shit with, I can’t get new friends, I can’t go to school (no money and also ruined my gpa my junior year thanks to drugs), I can’t find happiness in the interests and hobbies I have/had anymore, I am completely and utterly stuck.

I have never worked a proper job because I have no experience but I can’t get experience because I can’t get a job because I have no experience. Currently doing doordash while borrowing my dads old shit box but the pay is horrible and its dangerous (car is ran through and very dated + Miami traffic, hooray)

Can’t start dating to save my life. Pushing 20 and have never even kissed anyone before. Used to be very ugly all throughout high school. I have glowed up since then but having the luck that I have now the cards have switched and its no longer my looks holding me back but rather not having access to girls. Asked out an old friend I had a thing for, she said sure, and then rejected me in person. Another girl asked me for my IG at a mall but after just 2 days of talking she revealed that she has uh a lot of “history” and I realized that she was just gonna turn me into her fucking therapist so I kindly told her that this wasn’t gonna work. (This all happened last week btw). Back to square one and have zero options to go for, again

I have 2 friends but they’re both lame as hell. One is addicted to his 2 jobs (doesn’t wanna help me get hired btw) and the other one never leaves the house. Can’t make new friends to save my life either. 

Can’t go to school (broke and academic record in shambles, like I mentioned)

Tried joining the Army to just hit a reset button on life completely. Got a high score on the asvab, had a really good medical job secured, but then like always shit went south for no fucking reason, had to choose another job, got frustrated and told them that I was just gonna join the air force instead. Andddd now I have a couple of butthurt grown ass men trying to make it as hard as possible for me to continue with the air force. Probably gonna be stuck in Miami for like another year before they finally let me continue so that’s that for now

I used to make music and read a lot. Now all I do is go to the gym. Im very satisfied with how much I’ve been able to change my body in just a year, but realistically, it hasn’t made my life any better. Sure, I fit in clothes way better and girls treat me completely differently, but Im still as miserable as when I was tubby and if anything my new obsession with the gym has just sucked all the old artistic passions I had.

This is probably the first time in my life where I genuinely cannot find a way out. It feels like my life is on a permanent standby right now.

1m77q6b,"Need a therapist. Too scared of therapists even get one, much less for therapy to be useful.","Hi! I've been struggling to post this for a long time, I'm not sure how to explain it and even talking about it is terrifying. I've been varying degrees of (mostly) passively suicidal (never actively attempted bc I feared the consequences of surviving) for at least 20-22 of the almost 26 years I've been alive and in therapy on and off since I was maybe 8. Earlier than that (I think 1st grade? It's all fuzzy sorry) I was sent to the achool counselors on a weekly basis for ""therapy"" gave up on me after a while.

In all that time I've had maybe 1.5 good therapists. The others have all been emotionally damaging to some degree. I'm really dumb so as a child it took me a long time to realize the seemingly random punishments at home were because of things my therapist and school counselors were telling my dad behind my back—after explicitly telling me to that they would *not* be calling my dad. Often I didn't say *anything*. My selective mutism would act up when hit with surprising tough questions i.e. ""do you have thoughts of hurting yourself?"" and they would take it as guilt-by-omission (the results of this have led to some of the most traumatic moments of my life)

Most of the time it was punishment for being not-mentally healthy enough. I have panic attacks and severe social anxiety that prevented me from doing my school work often, and my dad would punish me for my ""laziness"" and ""dramatics"" by cornering me and screaming for hours on end. If I tried to convince him my problems were real I'd be threatened with hospitalization—and told more or less that I would be ""ruined"" by it and he nor anybody else could ever love me again.

I finally tried therapy and medication as an young adult to not-much success. The medications (I tried a lot) made me sicker and I have an eating disorder now as a result of them permanently fucking up my brain chemistry. My therapists weren't very helpful either.

I've been trying again as an adult with my own insurance, with increasingly worse results with each time. One I tried to work with for months and leave me feeling so invalidated and  frustrated that I thought about killing myself just to make her see how damaging her words were. 

I took a long break after her and in the interim I lost my mom. I tried again months later bc my anxiety and depression were getting worse and I started sh again. I liked my new therapist but I was still too scared to tell him anything (and already resolved to not tell him abt the sh) I spent one whole session wordlessly crying bc I was so overwhelmed by everything I couldn't pick a topic to start with. I focused really hard on planning before the next one to make sure I had my thoughts in order and was excited to finally make some headway—only for him to cut me off before I had time to finish summarizing how my week went and started telling me I'm too crazy to work with and hard-selling me on going inpatient. It was extremely triggering and I immediately started having my worse panic attack in years while he yelled over my begging him to stop bc I couldn't breathe.

Now I'm worse off than I think I've ever been before and can't go on without any support, but I'm still so traumatized by the last guy that even looking for them online has been causing panic attacks. I've sceduled a few consults, but go mute or yell at them without meaning to. When I ask other people for advice they say ""you should talk to a therapist about that"" with no awareness of the irony. What do I do now?

1m7d3v2,"Anxiety and new relationships, any advice ?","So the story: i met him during therapy (grouptherapy 3x full days in a week). 

I was on and off with my horrible, constantly cheating ex. 

He met his ex when he was in the psychiatry ER 4 months prior. His ex cheated on her ex with him. My boyfriend was in a very vulnerable state back then and she pushed him into a relationship. That was his first relationship. When they were together, he was always talking about that he had this suffocating feeling and that he had never experienced heartbreak or even falling in love. He was always talking very badly about her but he just couldn’t leave and they would have a lot of fights.

During therapy i slowly started falling in love with him. I decided to “end” things with my ex but we were not together, i just needed to talk to him and make it clear to him that i’ve fallen in love with someone else. My whole friendgroup dropped me when i reconnected with my ex so i’m pretty lonely now too. 

I did not want to interfere in that relationship, i was happy that i could have feelings in the first place. 

We went out together and we declared our love to eachother. He had this terrible crush on me and he said that this was the first ever that he has felt this way. That he wanted to introduce a girl to his friends and parents. After that night he immediately broke up with her and a week after he explained her everything.

And when I mean little I mean tiny (I’ve got plenty of big problems too but those make sense to be stressed about).

I got to work, fixed my tire got all sweaty when I just wanted to look nice for once, got into my office and took my blazer off and the arms turned completely inside out.

1m7cuhi,Best friend leaving,"I (21M) was never good at making friends. It always sucked to meet people because I'm extremely quiet normally. And, although I've never been diagnosed officially, used to suffer through depression.

There were years where I basically talked to nobody, including my first year of the Uni I ended up leaving. Once I moved away from that, I set myself the goal that I would try to hang out with others no matter how uncomfortable/unfit I would feel. While that helped, I never got to have a close friendship/relationship with someone.

Fast-forward to the second year of leaving, I ended up being best friends with someone doing an exchange in my university. It's accurate to say we did everything together: slept together in his apartment for months (though I had my own), went to the gym together, going out together, doing groceries together, studying together, going on vacation together by ourselves for the summer too.

However, his exchange year has ended, and he lives in another country. Now that he left it all feels so empty and meaningless, and I fear it's because if I'm alone I hate myself, even if I try not to care about it and shrug it away. When we said our goodbyes, he told me to respect myself more because ""I've got potential"" and in his words I'm the funniest guy ever, so I shouldn't get too insecure about my personality.

Actually following that advice feels difficult for me. I've been going to the gym every day since he left so I've got something to show for myself and to try to feel better about myself, but I've basically been acting on Autopilot and crying myself to sleep because of how lonely and pointless I feel now. I don't think I'll ever be able to have such a good relationship with anyone else, and I feel slipping back to myself 2 years prior where I could not get in touch with anybody in fear that I could be annoying dead weight to others.

I'm really not sure how to feel better. What else should I do, and how do I cope with it? I feel I should also let him live his life and just accept that this chapter has ended, but I still end up crying myself and missing him so much.

1m76x86,"Someone help me, I want my mental healt back","My name is David, and I decided to publish this post because I've been experiencing a very difficult mental and emotional situation for some time, which is seriously affecting my quality of life.

Specifically, I believe I suffer from a form of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), likely with characteristics of obsessive doubt/intrusive thoughts/false memories, but I've never received an official diagnosis.

Here's what happens to me:

I have sudden and absurd intrusive thoughts, completely against my will, often meaningless, and completely at odds with my personality.

These thoughts generate intense anxiety and push me to doubt actions or events, as if I can no longer clearly distinguish between reality and imagination.

I sometimes convince myself that I've done something serious or absurd, or I obsessively doubt it for days, for no apparent reason and without being able to find relief.

I know rationally that these thoughts are illogical and unfounded, but I can't stop thinking about them, and I even spend entire days ruminating or trying to ""figure out"" what happened.

I live with a strong sense of confusion, fear of going crazy, and constant anxiety, sometimes to the point of feeling completely mentally and emotionally drained.

I've never used substances or had psychotic episodes, but I feel increasingly disconnected from reality, as if I'm losing control of myself.

I feel tired, worn out, and desperate, so I urgently need help. If anyone knows what this is, please help me.

I'd be available to both evaluate possible pharmacological treatment, if necessary, and to begin psychotherapy specifically for these disorders.

1m7c6bh,"my best friend is being really unsupportive while i’m at the crisis center, and i don’t know what to do","i’m currently in the crisis stabilization unit because things in my life have gotten really bad. i’ve been silently struggling without my meds, my mental health hit a breaking point, and i’m about to lose my housing. i’m in an actual emergency and didn’t know where else to turn, so i came here to try and stay safe.

my roommate and best friend is out of town on a family vacation and won’t be back until two days before we have to move out. as soon as i told him i was going to the crisis unit, he called me selfish, said i betrayed and lied to him, and that if i actually cared about him i would’ve just gone home. he also told me only “rich people” get mental health treatment and that coming here was a horrible financial decision because i have debt.

he’s really stressed about us moving, and i understand that. but the truth is, i haven’t even been able to pack at all because of how much anxiety and distress i’ve been in. he keeps saying i was managing fine before i left and that i’m just experiencing “normal moving stress,” but that’s just not true. i’ve been dealing with so much. more than one person should have to handle alone. and now i’m in this position with no real support system.

i know deep down he probably means well, but what he’s been saying has really messed with my head and made me question whether coming here was the right choice. i feel guilty for putting myself first when he’s not even here and the move is coming up, but i also know staying alone in the apartment for a week with how suicidal i was feeling wouldn’t have been safe.

i don’t know what to do. i feel torn between protecting my mental health and trying to not lose one of the few people i have left. has anyone else been through something like this? how do you deal with someone you care about not understanding how serious things are?",1,1,1753284185.0,mentalhealth,sweetroseorchid,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7c6bh/my_best_friend_is_being_really_unsupportive_while/,2025-07-25T09:58:17.278201

Hello guys!
If you want you can go to my profile and see the past few posts I made if you want to, but I got home and my life has been a mess after long distance, he's busy, not as affectionate as he used to be, I also got a bit more serious with him so my life is all about him now. It's not his problem cause I have been like this since my past 3 relationships, because of this I really don't want to care what harm and trauma it has caused to me but to my career as well. I keep thinking that my boyfriend maybe doing something wrong, he can cheat on me, what will I do when he hurts me in future. I need to have some self respect. My mother has suffered a lot with my father and her affairs but she has taught me that having a man is all she cares about and maybe that's what I care about too. I used to be a very talented and confident girls who was also smart but now I don't really have any plans for future, it hurts and I know I will regret this in future. Can you guys suggest some ways I can maybe be happy by my own too and focus on myself and build a good life for myself. Give some suggestions guys, if you can.

1m7c26i,Why can’t I do my routines when I’m with other people?,"When I’m alone (living alone or no one in the house), I can do all of my “self help” things like keeping a schedule, eating better, sleep schedules, journaling, exercising, etc. PERFECTLY. But once I’m in a place where there are constantly other people around, all of it seems to go out of the window immediately. The relationships I have aren’t bad because I know my loved ones truly are supportive of whatever I do. When I lived alone, I would casually tell them about the things I do and habits I build and I don’t feel anything “negative” about telling them and receive nothing but love and support for it. But whenever I’m PHYSICALLY around others I don’t seem to have the motivation and/or discipline to actually do the things that I KNOW benefit me. It’s like I just stop caring and that’s what I don’t understand.

For example, I recently had to move back in with family and looking back at my journal entries (that I consistently did daily), there is a hard cut off on the day I actually moved back in. There are some sporadic entries but it’s hasn’t been as consistent as before. And I know I didn’t forget about the habits, because I think about why I’m not doing them and I get disappointed in myself when I don’t do them and yet… I still just don’t do it and I’m truly not sure why.

I enjoy doing them too! I like journaling outside, I like the running high I get when I exercise, I like the way my body feels when I have a variety of vitamins and nutrients, I like how peaceful my life is when I do those things regularly, so why do I just stop doing it, (causing me to not feel good) when I’m around literally anyone for a consistent period of time? Living with family? I’ve stopped doing it. Visiting a friend for a week? Nothing. Visiting my long distance boyfriend (va to or)? Absolutely nothing.
 
I thought that maybe it was laziness, but if it was that then I wouldn’t do it by myself either, right? And like I said, I know I’m not just forgetting to do it, it’s like I’m choosing to not do it. Because I want to, but I don’t at the same time, but literally only when I’m around others! 

I’m wondering if anyone else experiences this or knows what it could be indicative of.",1,0,1753283924.0,mentalhealth,AriSa_EarthFairy,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m7c26i/why_cant_i_do_my_routines_when_im_with_other/,2025-07-25T09:58:17.278201
1m76qkn,I’m a fool and I hurt but I don’t wanna give up yet,"I mean look at me, self harm scars I’m sure people are disgusted and even if I’ve quit the damage is done and that urge is still there. The two times I’ve ever felt real feelings, a real connection with someone I was played like a fiddle once and I even believed it a second time around haha then the next time around I feel for someone again only to have potentially be used the same way. I’m used and I’m thrown out like a piece of garbage, no explanation or anything. I know I’m not a good person and maybe I deserve to hate myself but I’m fucking tired. I’m 23 with no job and it’s not like I’m not looking but I never even get called in for an interview except for once and I thought it went well only for me to never get a call back even though they said they would. My friend who meant the world to me left me one day and I don’t even fully know why but maybe it’s my depression, maybe I’m crazy and it was for the best they got the hell away from me.

 I feel like it’s only a matter of time before everybody else leaves me or maybe people secretly hate me or look at me with disgust. When my grandparents pass I have family but I don’t feel like I’ll have any of them truly be there and I’ll just be alone fucking rotting just like I did for years after graduation hating myself. I miss the self harm and it’s only been a few weeks and I’m so tired. I know I’m worthless and I’m not worthy of anything so why can’t I die. I don’t believe in a god but if there is one why torture me, let me love and care, give me hope only to snatch it away and laugh in my face. Nobody wants to be around someone like me and all I’ll do is drag everyone down until they’re drowning with me. I’m so embarrassed of anyone being seen with me cause  I know I’m a failure, a self harmer and a fool who just wants to not feel so alone. I’ve made more friends and they’re a heaven send cause they keep me grounded along with my best friend who always calms me no matter what and I care so much for them but how long until I ruin that and I’m back at square one.

 I can’t die and living is hell so what the hell am I supposed to do other than take the shit the world throws at me. Some part of me is angry, hurt and wants to lash out at the world but I know I just hate who I am cause I’m where I am cause of myself. Not cause of the traumas I faced as a kid but the conscious decision I’ve made to be a horrible son, grandson, brother, nephew and friend. My life is a joke and I’m a joke and I don’t deserve love whether it’s platonic or romantic. I feel like my only path in the future is either death or I walk alone slowly losing everyone I’ve ever cared about. I’ve got my moments where my depression hits a low, lower than usual and causes me physical pain.
That feeling is always there even when I feel like I’m getting better cause I can’t help it. I’m a joke and I’m pathetic but I atleast want my life to mean something and be able to help push others forward. I still want to fight so people don’t feel so alone like I used to and still do at times. No matter the situation I want to be able to say even if I hated living I made the best of a bad situation and I dedicated myself to a better future, if not for myself then those around me, family and strangers alike<3

He asked me if I had ever been on anything for my anxiety until 2 weeks ago and I said no.He proceeded to tell me that I should go for counseling instead and not take anxiety medication because I'd be taking them until I'm old. I'm still young. He said I didn't really have anxiety but anemia. And said that I'm the first patient that had anxiety when outside the house and not inside. I explained to him that I've been feeling like this ever since I was a teenager and just been coping like this but I decided to get help for it because the nurse noticed it everytime. And from that he said that if I really needed it I would've started it along time ago and not just now. When I asked him about my other medical problem I had he didn't really talk about it and I told my concerns about it and he said it's fine without properly checking at it like the woman doctor had done when I had her for the first two previous visits. But still he prescribed me 2 months worth of pills even after all that talk.

I was a big crybaby as a little boy and then it just went away. Not just this, but there’s so much in life I could cry about but I just can’t. My body feels sad but I’m not sad enough to cry.

Nothing is what it is because I feel it, I feel too much of it. I can’t not think about it and be sad about it. I try to act stress free a lot but I think it’s a cover up for me being super emotional and caring. The less I think, the stupider I am, the less I get sad.

But there are times I'm wishing that I should be traveling or spend more time with my family. I had a 2 weeks vacation recently and I was only able to enjoy the first two days, the rest I was thinking of work. 

My Dad is the same. He has his own cleaning company and it's well structured and organized to the point that it's independent of him. But he choses to work more than he should. We have no financial problems or whatsoever, and there's no reason for us to be working as much. Everytime he's at home he's thinking of work, and I can feel that he's not enjoying any family activities because of it. He mentioned before that he's a control freak. Although he trusts his employees he feels that it's much better if he can supervise. 

I can absolutely see my patterns to my dad. My partner and I recently fought in the middle of our vacation because she feels like my mind was somewhere else.

1m7baho,I've been unable to save money because this stress has been tearing me apart.,"I hope this post isn't going to be detected as something that it's not. I've been facing a lot of stress for so much time. Hey, I told my third-grade teacher in a letter to her that every student had to write as an assignment on our first day of the academic year that I was ""very anxious."" And even though this account is under my real name, I have no problem ""outing myself"" here. I already get Trezor phising emails.

My stress has gotten better and better as time has gone on, but it's still awful for me. In 2014, I had 1.02 BTC. There was no way that I was going to be able to keep it. I spent it on an Intel computer processor (a Core i5-4690) the day before going to France to visit my grandmother. I screamed in my sleep being in France because I was under so much stress. I would scream in my sleep sometimes when I was still living at my parents' house. Well, I haven't gone back to France since 2014 when I used to often visit France to visit relatives.

In early 2020, I had 1.44 BTC purchased with financial aid refunds. I was under much less stress than I was under in 2014, but there was still no way that I was going to be able to keep ""what I had."" And I had plenty of chances to recoup what I spent with further financial aid refunds and CARES Act funds. But I spent each opportunity that I had.

It's now 2025, and no, I don't have any Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin, you may wonder? I'm the least thing from a zealot. Given my circumstances of being on benefits, cryptocurrency has been the only way that I've been able to save money. My life circumstances make me stupid...and for the longest time, no one cared. I now have real friends, including one who I talk to each day, and that has helped, but my stress hasn't gone away. My days are so long. I often stay up all night so that I don't have to be awake during the day, which I'm often not when I sleep all night, anyway.

I hope that a remote job and a car...eventually, can help fix things. I'm still trying so hard, and the stress is eating me alive and tearing me apart. My best friend sees it. My mother sees it.

1m763lt,I didn’t care when my uncle or any family member died,"Hello, first time posting on Reddit. For reference, I’m 13yo. 

I know the title sounds cruel, and I guess it is. This is technically a vent, but I need some opinions and thoughts on it. I’ll start off with my uncle. He died in 2020, so 5 years ago. I had just turned 9 at the time because he died 2 days after my birthday. I witnessed my mother getting a phone call right in the morning and being told by my aunt he died from a heart attack (or something. Can’t remember.) I witnessed her literally start screaming and crying, and she was depressed (a lot in the beginning) for like 2-3 years. The whole family was, but me. It’s not like I didn’t understand what death was at the time, I did. I used to watch a lot of horror and stuff like that because I had internet access early. I knew perfectly well he wouldn’t come back, forever. But honestly? I didn’t think much of it. Never cried. I guess I sound like an asshole, because I had a lot of good memories with the man. I remember a lot of things from my childhood, so there was no reason for me not to be upset and cry. I just never did. My mother and father left for the funeral (it was in another country) and I stayed with my cousins for a week.

When my friend found out about my uncle, even she began crying. She didn’t even know the man.

As a kid, I apparently used to cry a lot thinking about my parents dying. They laughed it off, asking me why. They told me I said, I kid you not, “because who will I stay with? I want to live in this home.” Something along those lines. They looked at me strangely. You’d expect a kid to say “because I love you guys!” Or something like that. Not a kid worrying about who’ll pay the bills. 

My grandfather died a year after. My mother said it was heartbreaking, because he believed his son(my uncle) had been enlisted in the military and that’s why he’s not home. I remember one day while I was visiting family, my grandmother, mother, and aunt were all sobbing uncontrollably while I was in the room. My mother started yelling at me. She said something along the lines of “Why haven’t you cried for [uncle’s name]? Or [grandfather’s name]?” And i remember she threw an insult like bad child or something. I started crying while my aunt rushed to comfort me. When she asked why I was crying, I said “because she called me a bad child”. 

Throughout the years, some people around me have died. My cousins, uncles, a friend, etc. I’ve never really cared, because everyone is going to die anyway. I genuinely thought it was a normal thing not to care that much. 

Until my father and mother sat me down for a talk. It got heated, and we were arguing. My parents began claiming I’m antisocial, don’t care about anyone, nothing interests me, I don’t talk to them, etc. I wrote down specifically what my father wrote to think about it later. He said : 

“You’re a psychopath and apathetic. There’s no way you could be our daughter.” 

I guess I’m a bit different from the rest of my family, but it kind of hurt when he said that. Of course I’m their daughter. I told one of my close friends, and she agreed with him.

I can’t get a therapist. Or get diagnosed. I don’t want to. I don’t want that to be “on my record”. People will probably see me differently. If someone’s specialized in this sort of stuff, could you diagnose me? I just wanna know for myself. Anyways, people of Reddit, please tell me your thoughts on this.

Since I knew about the statement ""we are going to die anyway"", I can't help but to know and accept that this is true. Nothing matters, I don't even know what the meaning of life must be. Is it worth living? I'm afraid of trying—anxious about the future, will I ever make it? Will I even achieve the dreams I ought to be? What if I die in a sudden death? I barely feel anything.

1m75twq,I almost drowned this weekend but I don't feel any gratitude about still being alive. What can I do?,"Im a 21 year old woman, and I've always struggled with mental health, SH, and I've made attempts on my life when I was a kid. I've been on medication, going to therapy, and all that jazz and I've managed to do a lot better. However, I still going really deep cycles of depression . Im in one now, and it's been about two months.
On Sunday (three days ago now), my boyfriend and I went kayaking, which is something we do all the time and we loved it. This time, though, I accidentally flipped the boat over while trying to hop out for a swim. Neither of us realized how fast the current was, we started in shallow water and got swept into deeper water where I couldn't reach the floor. my bf and I were separated. He went down river trying to gather our belongings while I kept getting dragged by the current. Im a good swimmer, but this was so terrifying. He eventually got into the boat and came back for me.
I survived obviously but I kinda wish I didn't and I'm struggling with that. Im not even sure what kind of answer I'm looking for, but I had to talk about it. I think I just want comfort.

1m6y7hr,my mom unintentionally killed my cat. i don’t know how to forgive and move on,"tw: abuse

he was already sick beforehand. an autoimmune disorder that caused gum inflammation which resulted in us having to remove his teeth. he was a foster and he was my cat, he was around 3 when he died and i loved him with all my heart. my mom left ibuprofen on the bed for me, and by the time i got to it he had eaten one and licked the other until the colour came off. i asked her to take him to the vet, she refused until hours later when he was visibly sick. by then his kidneys had failed. we put him down the next day. 

she’s said sorry so many times. i know she feels bad. but i can’t help but feel mad at her. she would threaten to put him down because he was sick (we didn’t know when she threatened to put him down) and not always peeing in the litter box. she refused to listen to me. he could have lived if we had taken him earlier

he could still eat. cats chew food by crushing it with their mouth, the vets said there was a good chance he’d make a full recovery and be okay. but now i’ll never know because he’s dead.

I got enoughom of myself and started losing weight, exercising, I still can't believe it I got into university and graduated recently.

1m71lpz,I feel subhuman,"  I don't know what I'm doing with my life and I hate myself for it

I'm 20, studying medical technology, and I honestly feel like I’m too dumb for it. Not in a self-pitying way, but like I genuinely can’t keep up. I procrastinate, zone out in class, fail exams, and spiral instead of fixing anything. Then I hate myself for it, and the cycle just keeps going. I wake up ashamed of who I am, of what I’m not doing, of everything I’ve wasted.

I used to think I was smart, or at least capable of becoming someone. But transitioning from high school to university has felt like slow-motion proof that I’m not cut out for any of this. That I’m just pretending to be normal, functional—when in reality I’m barely holding on. I look around and see people figuring things out, getting jobs, socializing, adapting. And I just feel... stuck.

I’ve started wondering if I’m neurodivergent. There are moments I completely miss what someone’s really saying, or I answer things too literally. Conversations don’t click the same way for me. I relate to things too abstractly, or too logically, and it makes me feel detached. I think something about the way I developed—especially being alone so much, glued to the internet, watching messed up videos, rant channels, gore, browsing image boards left me kind of broken socially and emotionally.

I ghost my friends even though they’re good people. I vanish for weeks, feel guilty about it, then come back acting like nothing happened. It’s not that I don’t care or idk, but I feel like I’m not meant to be part of anyone’s life long-term. Like I’m some side character who overstays his welcome. So I dip. And then I hate myself for being alone.

Sometimes I think about how I’ve always felt like a freak. Like I’m wearing a mask and saying lines someone else wrote. Even when good things happen—when I get compliments, when people notice me, when I’m with others—I still feel like I’m faking it. Like I’m performing. Nothing feels fully real.

I’ve also had thoughts I don’t like admitting. Not really suicidal, but close. More like, if I died tomorrow, that’d be fine. If I got hit by a car, it wouldn’t be tragic. It would just end all this weight. And I don’t know what that says about me, other than I’m tired. Tired of being behind. Tired of being scared. Tired of feeling inhuman.

I’ve talked before about wanting to change. About building a better body, having a future where I live far from all this modern noise. A wife, kids—some kind of meaning. But right now I’m nowhere near that. I feel like a shut-in trapped in his own skin. Someone who’s getting worse, not better.

I don’t even know what I want from this post. I guess I just want to feel seen. To know if anyone else has felt this alien and stuck. And if you have… how did you survive it?

1m750f3,Terrified I’m gonna k1ll myself this school year. I can’t let my family down,"15M going into 10th grade. Last time I tried to make one of these I exceeded the character limit and couldn’t post it. I’ll try to add less details. 
Been feeling like this for a little over a year 

Won’t give the history too much so I don’t exceed the limit, but right now I’m stuck in a really lonely state that consists of sitting in my room, playing video games, boring myself to death, and not going outside. I only feel like my family cares about me and all 3 of my siblings go to college next year.  The only thing stopping me from killing myself already is the guilt I’d have for putting my family through that.

I really wish I had more company. I have “friends” but I don’t get invited to really anything and I’m none of their favorite person. I wish I had a girlfriend but I know committing to going places with her would be hard. I hate going outside my house to do things, even if it’s getting food I literally like. Maybe even seeing friends but how would I know since they don’t invite me to anything? I’ve tried to ask them, it’s always a maybe and then no confirmation. I don’t know why I don’t want to go places. I’ve always been an inside guy, I don’t even play sports (get made fun of that every millisecond) but it’s never been this bad. I don’t know what’s wrong with me that makes me not fit in. I used to have a ton of friends, until they all simultaneously dumped me for no apparent reason in 8th grade.

The reasons I want to k1ll myself. 1, I’m lonely. 2, No one understands how I feel. (I’ve tried to communicate through TikTok reposts but no one reaches out, I know they see them because I do it so much and they like a lot of reposts which I get notified for.) 3, I don’t find enjoyment in life. I have things I like, music(IP LOVE MUSIC), video games, astronomy, philosophy, but none of that is bringing me purpose. I suppose I could be an astronomer when I grow up but those dreams don’t overcome my wish to die. 4, kind of similar to other reasons but I don’t have anyone to talk to about my feelings. I’m too scared of being judged by my parents and my ‘friends’ gossiping or also judging me. 5, I just overall feel so misunderstood. Not to sound corny but all I feel like to people at school is a side character that has no dialogue option. I’ve tried talking to them. Most of them are just immature.

I don’t even cry anymore and I used to be a huge crybaby. I just feel like a bottomless pit (death grips reference?). Like an empty void. I just zone out and wonder why I’m like this.

I don’t know of any mental conditions I have.

I know that I should go to therapy or whatever but I’m really bad at expressing my feelings in a real life scenario. I need a lot of time to think of what to say and how to describe my current state accurately. Plus I never understand how anything they do would help me.

To add, my worst nightmare is tomorrow. A 2 week vacation I’ve pretended to be excited for super far from home. I’m super thankful, don’t get me wrong, but vacations I almost always hate especially when they’re long. I don’t know how to tell my parents that I don’t wanna go. If I told them that I feel really depressed/suicidal I would feel terrible because they’re all excited and at least one if not all of them would now have to stay home. My mom has family where we’re going too.

I haven’t got into every detail of how this happened but this is the state I’m in.

1m79dou,I always spiral,"Hi, I am really needing to speak to someone that understands. For reference, I am F (26), and have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety, Major Depression, PTSD, and OCD. I feel as though my bipolar disorder is pretty much treated, but maybe I'm wrong. My biggest struggle is with my OCD.

Anyway, whenever I feel as if I have hurt someone, or someone tells me that I have hurt them, I spiral and feel this extreme urge to punish myself. I obsess over it and then seek reassurance and safety in my partner when they are already struggling. I have this crushing feeling like it is the end of the world. I mostly feel this when I hurt my partner, because she means the most to me and I never want to hurt her. Whenever she brings up concerns about our relationship to me, I immediately feel like I'm a f\*ck up for not making her 100% happy. I feel guilty and shameful for not being a better spouse.

I don't want to emotionally abusive by turning it around on me and playing the victim. I want to  be able to take her concerns and make myself a better person and spouse by listening to them and changing what I need to change. I reached out to an OCD specialist today and am hoping to hear back ASAP. I just don't understand why I feel this extreme urge to punish myself.

1m74ra0,I feel like I'm becoming Jo March and it's worrying me,"Yes, I mean the character from Luisa May Alcott's Novel but more specifically Saoirse Ronan playing Jo in Greta Gerwig's movie.
I have that specific monologue branded into my brain. But to me, the most important part is where Jo claims that, while she is sick of this expectation placed on women to be a wife and mother, she is lonely and that she wishes and cares more to be loved than love someone. And her mother says that being loved is not the same as loving.

Anyways, this is what I am, basically. I am a young woman, almost 25 with no romantic experience at all. The closest I got to romance was the crush I had on another student in 8th grade who rejected me lol. No holding hands, no flirting, no kissing and no romantic relationship so far.
However, I am a hopeless romantic, a writer, and slowly begin to feel like I am behind in life.
My sister as well as my best friends have all had at least 1 or 2 romantic relationships, my cousins as well, one even got married recently. It's not that the love I feel for them is any lesser than the love romantic couples feel, but seeing everyone find a significant other while I can't even get to a talking stage, feels so horribly lonely. As if something is wrong with me.

And it's just like... I want romantic love. I want to know what it feels like and yes, just like Jo I care more to be loved. To know that there is someone out there who loves all the many things about me and who desires me despite all my shortcomings. And there are many, I tell you.

But at the same time, the thought of letting someone in. Like truly let them look inside, scares the shit out of me.

1m74n8s,im so obsessed with someone and it’s ruining my life,"I’ve been obsessed with this person since september (literally when i met them). i don’t know why, we aren’t that close and we barely talk. theyre actually closer to my best friend, which has destroyed me. i am constantly thinking about them and it’s ruining my life. i don’t even think what i feel is love, its just genuine obsession. i don’t know what mental illness this stems from, i have adhd and ptsd. it seems more like i have bpd, but i dont want to diagnose myself. anyways…this story is so juvenile so bare with me. recently, my best friend admitted to having feelings for this person. i also told her about my feelings, since i hadn’t yet. what i didnt say was how long it’s been and how deep it goes. we just had another conversation, in which i told them the circumstances of my feelings. and at the end i basically told them “if you two ended up together, i couldn’t be happy for you and you would lose me as a friend.” which is true. but now i feel terrible about it. they told me they aren’t planning on confessing (i’m not either) but if they did i just gave them a really hard ultimatum. 

it’s my own fault that i haven’t done anything about it, especially when i had a chance to- when the person was closer to me than my best friend. which was true at some point. there’s so many things i could’ve done differently within the almost year that ive known them, but i’m so messed up. i could’ve reached out more. i could’ve asked them to hang out. but now everything is ruined. i just want to go back to the fall and winter. everything was perfect between us. we were a trio. now we’re like 2 separate duos. maybe everything changed because we have a fake rivalry and i took it too far. now they have a fake rivalry with my best friend and we don’t bully each other like we used to. yes, i am so very jealous of my best friend, if it isn’t obvious. they’re always touching each other and are practically on top of each other when we hang out. i used to have a theory that they’re actually together and not telling me bc it would make hangouts awkward. its fucking torture. i just want this to go away. therapy isn’t working. i’m even trying to date and they’re still always in my thoughts when i talk to this girl. i am in so much pain every day because of this, and the whole situation is constantly on my mind. i feel genuine anguish right now because the person hasn’t invited me over to watch a show like they said they would. i’m constantly expecting a text from them.

it’s ridiculous that i get so upset and i panic when they hang out by themselves. it’s ridiculous that i never had the courage to confess, even when faced with the perfect opportunity. i hate myself.

anyways lol, thanks for reading this. if anybody has any advice or stories similar to mine i would love to see them.

1m78vzy,Feeling people watching me- even when alone.,"Before I start this, I want to say I have social anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder, and (homebound)agoraphobia, also pretty bad Maladaptive daydreaming. But I feel as if these issues have nothing to do with what I’m currently experiencing.

For a little over three years, I’ve been constantly feeling like people are watching me and reading my thoughts or looking at my screen, to the point it’s really embarrassing to even write this post.

It’s not like the typical paranoid type- it’s different to when I feel paranoid. I feel like the people- usually imagined as my family or fictional characters I’m interested in, are just watching my every move and judging me for it. I even try and think different thoughts or act differently than I used to just so they don’t think badly of me.

I’m not comfortable even in my room anymore. I can’t eat or drink because they’ll be judging my portion or choice, I can’t watch shows or read because of what they’ll think. I often have to think my emotions just so they don’t get the wrong idea of me agreeing or disagreeing with an opinion, but solely what I’d think they’d agree with. It’s become to where I don’t act like how I did before this started, like I have to put on this pretend personality so I’m not embarrassing myself.

This is genuinely impacting my life. I feel stupid not being able to perform simple tasks or hobbies I love just because I don’t want to make a fool of myself or them being critical.

1m6tc33,I don't enjoy being a woman,"I'm so tired of being female. I want to tell myself and believe that gender is more complicated. Though, my family thinks otherwise. Both my dad and my aunt (she's a bit more extreme) think think in the 'it's biology' and 'you'll always be what you are.' My aunt says 'being a woman is amazing, why aren't you happy? You should be' and my dad says 'well men go through a lot.' Things like that. They say it's just a phase, and I'll figure something out in the future. I don't want to be a mother. I like feminine things, but I also want to do masculine things.
We got in a conversation today about the military. I don't want to act like violence is the best way to handle things. It would be hard for me to handle being yelled at, to be honest. Though, maybe I could work on that. On my sensitivity.
My aunt said something though. ""Women just hesitate. They aren't meant for battle or anything like that. They're much more emotional, and shouldn't be used if possible, even if they volunteer."" Not exactly, though that was the consensus.
I felt angry and miserable when thinking about it. I don't know what to believe. I don't want it to be true, but I can't help but think ""what if.""
They say it's basic biology. It's just how we work, it'll never change. I want to say it's how we're socialized, though she says it's like that because of estrogen and testosterone.
I hate it. I don't want to have to be a certain way. To be sensitive, to be dramatic. ""Women are nurturing, you should be happy about that!"" I DON'T WANT CHILDREN! I want to be kind, yes. Though I hate that fact that my brain may function the way they say. I don't want an emotional brain. I hate the fact they'll only see me in positions that are womanly. I do think about science. I also think about politics, maybe harder labor. Why can't I just change myself? Why? Why should I have to inherently be someone. To have traits. Why should I be happy about it? ""Being a woman is amazing, what are you talking about?"" You might enjoy. Hell, I enjoy things like sewing or cooking (which is a basic life skill, really.) All of that. I just hate the idea of this. I don't know why. Just not having any power. Being left to things considered soft or weak for men to do.
If this is all I'll ever be, why keep on going? Why not give up? Just because it's biology doesn't mean it's good. It's great that some like it, but I don't. I don't like it. I hate the idea I can't do things men can no matter how hard I try, while men can do anything, even things we can do, even if it takes effort. That we're weaker biologically. I don't care if I'm more 'naturing'. That doesn't mean anything if I don't want to be a mother. I fucking hate being a women if this is really all my aunt says it it.

Am I not as ""worrying"" as him just because I can suck it up and not whine all the time?? It sounds rude but like, a lot of the struggles him and her face is so inconsequential and ordinary I'm always shocked she expects sympathy. The ""struggles"" are quite literally just a friend not saying thank you when she does something unnecessary that wasn't expected of her or eating her food.

1m77o61,A Reflection for Students Coming from India to Abroad,"I want to share a message with all students planning to move abroad from India. Before coming here, I had a very different impression of life overseas. But after spending two years here, my perspective has changed significantly. I have seen many Indian students struggling emotionally and mentally. Some feel isolated and depressed, trying to adjust to a new environment far from home. In many cases, they get involved in multiple short-term or unstable relationships, perhaps seeking connection or escape from loneliness. Unfortunately, these relationships often aren’t long-term or meaningful, and I worry about the long-term impact on their mental and emotional well-being.

Back in India, their families are proud, believing their children are achieving great things while studying abroad: pursuing a master’s or PhD. But the reality for many is far more complex and, sometimes, troubling. It’s disheartening to witness people making choices that may not align with the values or goals they initially set for themselves. I also met individuals whose partners are in India, yet they are involved in other relationships here. It raises important questions about honesty, commitment, and emotional health This is not a judgment, but a sincere concern. I hope more students understand that life has a deeper purpose. Casual relationships, one-night stands, excessive alcohol, and living without emotional direction do not define a fulfilling life. In many of these situations, they are unknowingly harming their own mental health.

Coming from an Indian background, we often hold high regard for those studying abroad. However, it’s essential to look beyond the image and recognize the struggles and choices people face. I’ve also noticed that many times, Indians don’t support fellow Indians while living abroad  which is disheartening. Why is that? In a foreign land, where support and understanding matter the most, we should stand by each other. Let’s strive to build a more compassionate and supportive community, make healthier and more meaningful decisions, and stay grounded in the values and goals we truly believe in.",1,0,1753273027.0,mentalhealth,priya_nit,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m77o61/a_reflection_for_students_coming_from_india_to/,2025-07-25T09:58:18.560435

The weight on my shoulders has become to much to bare and im being crushed, the responsibility is to heavy a burden for just me and just ending things is always on my mind, i cant escape, i cant get a break, i’m shutting down and i just feel so lost and alone 

First i think the biggest chunk is financial, and the rest is undiagnosed mental health issues, if it were just me i’d be gone already, but i have an amazing partner and a healthy baby boy, im failing them both.

Its just me working, i make ok money for my area but i cant seem to get ahead, every step i take forward is 2 steps back

Im sorry if this is word salad, i’m crying my eyes out to the point of vomiting as im trying to write this, i cant get the constant self deprivation and suicidal thoughts out of my head, i just want it all to stop and the only thing stopping me is the fact that i’d be a mess someone else would have to clean up

Idk what to do, i dont know what to ask or where to go,  but i cant keep going on, i’m going to shut down soon, my mind feels like its so close to breaking and i cant afford any professional help, i cant even afford to buy groceries this week

I have no mental escape anymore, all i do is work and sleep, i dont have time for things i enjoy and even if i have free time i cant afford it.

Between constant suicidal thoughts and a lot of disturbing intrusive thoughts, my mind constantly has fake conversations that absolutely send me into a rage or deep uncontrollable sobbing, my grasp on my mask is slipping and i fear who i am when my mind breaks, my family isnt in any harm in any way, i’d give my life for them 10 times over no questions asked and i’ll do anything to make sure they’re ok

But at the end of the day i’ve given 150% every day for last 2 years, and i’m afraid that my tank is empty and im running on fumes

Please stop calling everyone who does harmful things to you a Narcissist. It is okay to say they were just a fucking asshole to you. Cut it. It's so fucking obnoxious.

Your parent or ex or boss or karen neighbor *most likely* does not have NPD, they are just a bitch.

1m70uan,(24) F i thought my life would be different,"i’m 24f and i’ve been feeling really depressed lately. i posted about this a few weeks ago on this subreddit, but honestly, nothing has gotten better.

i graduated university back in may, and despite applying to so many jobs, i still haven’t gotten anything. i’ve faced a bunch of rejections and it’s made me feel even more discouraged. i moved back home with my parents and my 5 siblings, and i’m sharing a room with my 6-year-old sister. it just feels so suffocating. i can’t even lie in bed and be sad without someone commenting on it.

i have anxiety and i’m scared to drive, so i don’t have my license yet. going out is really difficult because i’d have to rely on my parents for rides, as i don’t have money for ubers.

i was seeing a guy, and things ended badly. he wanted to see other people after 6 months of me trying to get him to commit. i’ve wasted so much effort, time, and money to someone who doesn’t care if i lived or died. i ended up cutting it off two weeks ago, but not before he gave me herpes. i know i deserve better, but part of me really wanted it to work because i honestly don’t know who else would want me. everyday i look in the mirror and just feel gross. recently i told another guy about my status for the first time. he had been saying he liked me and wanted to be with me, but ever since i told him, he hasn’t reached out. we had a thing last fall but he ghosted back then too. now he randomly came back saying he wanted to try because he genuinely liked me, but after opening up to him, silence.

i just feel like i don’t have any redeeming qualities. i have a degree, but i kind of just went through the motions of university. three years ago, i developed facial paralysis from immense stress, and my face still hasn’t fully recovered. it’s been another thing that makes me feel broken. 

i get jealous of people around me, my peers, even my younger sister (22). she has a good job, a car, and her boyfriend is taking her to mexico for her birthday. and i’m just… stuck. i feel like a loser. i know jealousy isn’t pretty, but it’s hard not to feel like life is passing me by. my entire life, i’ve always felt like i had to compete with everyone, and no matter how kind or hardworking i try to be, it never seems to matter.

i know some people have it worse than me, and sometimes i feel so guilty for even complaining, but i just feel so sad and hopeless. it’s like nothing i do is ever enough, and i’m tired. sometimes i wonder if i was better off just dead.",3,1,1753248226.0,mentalhealth,anonapplejack11,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m70uan/24_f_i_thought_my_life_would_be_different/,2025-07-25T09:58:18.560435
1m76hf4,i am losing myself to people pleasing,"Hi, I am a college sophomore and I have a huge problem. Since I was very young, I have always had a conflicted personality. I grew up in a very ""angry"" and ""conflicted"" family. I wouldn't hesitate to say that I was raised by child-like parents who had various mood swings. My parents truly lacked maturity despite having me in their thirties. They would scold me for the littlest things, and they always had extremely high standards for me—especially my mother. She would shout, blame, and mentally exhaust me from a very young age. So, as a coping mechanism, I developed this personality where I adapted myself to my parents' mood and demeanor. I would always say yes, nod obediently, and push down my feelings.

I learned to read my parents so well that now I avoid opening certain subjects or even saying specific ""trigger"" words for them so I can avoid their outbursts. As time went by, I developed this sh\*\*y, frustrating personality where I just pent up my feelings and give people what they want. I have developed this thing where I adapt myself to the person in front of me. I watch them carefully at first and absorb their personality, and if they ask me any question, I would give them an answer they would ""like"" rather than just answering truthfully. For example, if they ask what food I like, I wouldn’t say a food that I actually like—I would think about what kind of food they would like and then I would say that.

When I was younger, I found this ability to adapt so ""useful"" and ""helpful"" because I was so terrified of conflict. But as time went by, I have reached a point where almost every relationship in my life feels superficial. I feel like no one knows the real me—what I actually like and dislike. I have constructed a specific personality for each and every single person in my life. Like if I am speaking with ""Friend A,"" I automatically shift into a ""Friend A"" personality.

I have completely lost myself in this never-ending loop. I was okay back then because I had some sort of concept of who I truly am, but now I can barely recognize myself. I don't know what I like or dislike, what I believe in and what I don't, what are my goals, and what are my concepts in life. It’s so terrifying. As the days pass, I'm losing more and more of myself, and I believe I have become someone artificial.

Not only that, but I hold some deep sense of anger inside me. It gets super overwhelming sometimes. I can go an entire day feeling restless because of it. I am sincerely asking for true advice that I can actually use...

At the end of last year my mental health worsened severely and I believe i had my first bpd episode. While manic in Feb, i went to raves back to back which caused me to lose some hearing and i now have permanent reactive tinnitus that rings 24/7. this event caused a deep depression as i also had to cut off my then best friend who was my only emotional outlet. The last 5 months have consisted of me just trying to stay alive each day. every single day when i wake up, my first thought is how I should try to end my life so i don’t have to go through the day. I miss being maniac, my depression is worsening as my agoraphobia is kicking in which is causing me to stay home on my days off, doing nothing but sitting on my phone trying to pass the time. Feeding myself is extremely hard, i went 3 days last week without a meal, i recently lost 15 lbs. I force myself to show up at work and be energetic & hardworking because i have to pay the bills but outside of work i cannot function whatsoever. I’ve tried finding a therapist even receiving a referral but have been discouraged through long phone waits or never receiving calls back to make appointments. I’ve reached the point where living is too painful,everyday it feels like someone’s banging pots and pans next to my head. I have been distracting myself with tik tok, Netflix, sleep and disassociation because being conscious brings physical pain, it feels my brain is under a hydraulic press. I tried quitting my weed addiction which lasted two weeks until i was losing my mind from having 0 serotonin. My suicidal ideations are very bad as they are constant and intrusive. in reality I’m afraid of hurting myself but I have very severe urges to claw at my head or slam my head against something like I want to jump out of my body which is why I need to distract so much. I could try my hardest to make an appointment for a therapist but I would still have to wait a while for the appointment and intake and I feel like I’m losing my mind already. I haven’t done a single assignment in 3 weeks for my summer class because I can’t muster up the urge to give a damn. I’m not sure if there is any other route someone knows about to receive mental health treatment faster. Because I haven’t hurt myself yet, I am not sure if the psych ward should be an option.

1m70717,One week off Prozac. And the pain comes back to eat,"My son was murdered a little over 2 years ago.  The doc put me on prozac and I've been on it everyday until just over a week ago. I thought it was a godsend. It softened everything. I've been intense my whole life. It's helped in some things, work, business. Being obsessive is good for a lot of things. And it feels good. Gives you something to drive to.

With prozac, I became easy going. Definitely easier to live with. I know my wife and kids were happier with me. 

Now, coming down... or coming back, off of it; I feel like everything that's been pushed into a dark corner easy to ignore, is hitting me all at once. Part of me, maybe most of me, is fucking relishing in it. 

I'm alone here. My wife is away for at least another month. So I know I can hide it and not hurt her. Not physically, just with how I'm becoming myself again. With the mess, the mourning, over the last few years I know it's not fair to saddle her with my shitshow on top of the rest.

I sit in the starlight with a bourbon and cigarillo and cry and savor it.

I can't get over how much has been smothered. How much I haven't felt. And how the wave of it washes over me. Like a brutal old friend that knows my heart.

Ive raised three sons. One brutally butchered by fucking animals. The second had a mental breakdown, threatened to burn us out and was committed. The third, my namesake, is transitioning. So I mourn all three. Half heartedly under the fog of prozac for the last 2 years. Now I let it eat me.

1m75738,Are there any Discord servers with daily creative/reflective activities?,"Hello everyone. 

I’ve been dealing with anxiety and burnout for a long time, and I often struggle to keep up with routines that are good for my mental health. It gets easier when I’m part of a group, especially one where others understand what it’s like to live with similar challenges.

I have small tasks for each weekday... nothing serious, just stuff like “draw something with that guide” or “answer this journaling question.” It gives me a bit of focus, and helps me to not spiral when I’m overwhelmed.

Lately I’ve been wondering: is there anything like this already out there? A supportive online space (preferably Discord) where people do stuff together? Ideally it’s not super intense and not completely centered on “self-improvement”....

If anyone knows of something like this, I’d really appreciate a link or recommendation. I’m not looking for therapy or coaching or anything... just a low-pressure place with a bit of structure (daily challenges) and good people. And if not... maybe it’s something I’ll try to put together myself...",2,0,1753264959.0,mentalhealth,theInternetPassport,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m75738/are_there_any_discord_servers_with_daily/,2025-07-25T09:58:18.560435
1m753jd,How do I support my best friend with BPD without losing my own values in the process?,"Hi everyone,

I’m really struggling right now and would appreciate any insight or advice from those who’ve been in similar situations.

I'm going to be living with my best friend, who has BPD. I care about them deeply and understand that their condition brings immense emotional pain and instability. I’ve always tried to be supportive and empathetic as I deal with a variety of mental health issues myself, so I know what it’s like to feel misunderstood or overwhelmed. 

But lately, I’ve been finding myself caught in a constant cycle of destructive behaviours that are taking a toll on me. These include things like:

* talking behind people’s backs (even behind mine)
* intentionally or impulsively homewrecking
* snapping at others with little provocation
* twisting narratives to create conflict between people
* justifying behaviour that feels morally wrong to me

None of this is easy to write, because I don’t want to paint my friend as a villain - I know they’re hurting. But I’m hurting too. I’m starting to fear that being around this kind of behaviour 24/7 is slowly affecting *me*. I find myself questioning my own values, feeling numb, and worrying that I’ll either start to mirror the toxicity or lose my ability to see things clearly. I just don't feel like they are doing anything to help themselves and mitigate their symptoms - there is only so much that I can do.

I want to help, I really do. But I’m scared that staying so close, especially while living together, might come at the cost of my own mental health and integrity.

So I guess my questions are

* How do I support someone with BPD while also holding them accountable for toxic behaviour?
* How can I set boundaries without feeling like I’m abandoning them?
* How do I stay grounded and protect myself emotionally and morally in this situation?

I know there’s no easy fix, but if anyone here has advice, book recs, or just experience to share, I’d be really grateful. I just want to be a good friend to them, but also make sure that I do not become someone that I am not proud of.

1m6p3xu,Teen son struggling to make friends and feels lonely. How do I help him?,"I (dad) often go into my 14 year old son’s room to tell him good night once he’s gotten in bed. Sometimes we talk for a while.

I was just thinking we could maybe hang out just as like friends and stuff? I guess that’s kinda stupid. I was just thinking we could like talk and it just be really chill and like not a big deal you know?.”

I say “sure, that sounds like fun. What kinda stuff do you like to do with your friends?” He starts crying a little bit and says “I guess I don’t really have any friends.” I say I’m sorry to hear that. I suggest we try to find some sports or activities he enjoys where he can meet new people.

He says “I’ve already tried all that. It’s just really hard for me. I try to be friendly to people but no one seems to like me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I try talking to people but I just get nervous and stuff and it’s no fun. People will be nice to me but it never really seems to go anywhere. I really tried and I just don’t feel like trying anymore but then I feel lonely sometimes. It just really sucks.” 

I just give him a hug and let him cry for a while and tell him I’m always here for him. But it really hurts and I’m not sure what I can do for him?

1m74i3b,I can’t tell if the thoughts I am having are OCD related or not,"for context i do not have an ocd diagnosis but there are people in my family who struggle with it, i guess im just posting this because ive been feeling really trapped in my thoughts and not sure what it is.

im currently going through a breakup from a long term relationship, we ended off on decent terms until we decided to keep minimal
contact with each other, that didnt end up working out and long story short he ghosted my last message, which i guess im just not used to given we talked everyday so consistently for so long.

i keep thinking to myself and convincing myself that he is dead and thats why he decided to not reply to my message, even though us breaking up and our last conversation heavily justifies us cutting contact with each other. i feel so self aware but also conflicted. even when we were together, i would express to him i would overthink or have thoughts of him dying. 

In order to respect myself i dont want to break no contact with him because it ended exactly where it should have, but i am losing sleep trapped in the thought that hes dead and im an awful person for not knowing or checking.

this isnt the first time ive had sort of “obsessive” thoughts, something ive been doing alot lately is flushing the toilet when im in the bathroom but then 5 mins later going back to check and make sure i did even though i know i did before i left.

sometimes before bed i cant sleep until ive checked my social media stories multiple times to make sure i didnt accidentally post myself embarrassingly or naked or something. this one isnt a recent issue but it feels like i go through phases of thoughts 

im sure theres other examples from the past these are just the current ones im
struggling with and id really appreciate if anybody could share their thoughts or advice because i haven’t mentioned this to any of my close friends or family and i feel like i’m going crazy

1m74g8l,I've hit rock bottom :(,"I've really hit rock bottom...

I'm a spiritual person, but I've hit this point where I feel like Im definitely a waste of space or a burden...I don't know.. how to get out of it anymore.

I'm not the s word..  I'm just .. Feeling like I want to isolate from everyone I know and just be my own burden.

I grew up in a toxic environment. We had food, clothes, everything like that. But parents argued and sometimes fought physically almost every few days. To the extent that we have had police called (mainly by myself out of fear)
But I don't use that as an excuse... because we had it better than some. My education was good. We went on family trips and all of that.
However I do think I developed some anger issues.


Cut two to now. I'm engaged. I have an amazing fiance who consistently puts up with my ups and downs.

I feel guilty for eberytime I want to do something selfish. My life revolves around helping around at home and my parents. Sometimes I feel like Im compensating to my mom for my dad's lack of emotional support.
I feel guilty for spending anytime with my fiance and feel like I have to overcompensate at home for it.


Today I also made a huge mistake at work. 
And I'm frustrated with myself.

I'm just feeling like what's the point of trying to be a daughter, sister, fiance, daughter in law... all of it. When I'm just failing in all of them.

I sometimes have an urge after work now wanting to do something rather than zone out online...similarly at weekenfld.  But i have no idea what and i think that will get clearer as i connect to my own sense of self in time.

I find i would at the least rather go somewhere and maybe read (cant do it at home), or do anything.  Wary of spending money a bit on just another distraction regularly outside but keen to get out.

I kinda dont want to engage with others too much either as my sense of self is a bit confused and i dont want to just attach to others as a grip like i did before.

Also due to a few physical injuries i am getting alternative exercise thriugh lots of walking and cycling.  Gym etc is not an option currently.

Now that i have written it, wary this might be a me thing...but will see what others think

1m6y32q,Derealization? [TW: mentions of panic & death],"
For a while now I have been experiencing what I believe is derealization. The few ways I can describe it is my vision gets blurry or I can only focus on a few things, I space out, I repeatedly think if I’m dreaming, daydreaming, being controlled, if what I’m doing is actually happening. 

This particularly happens when driving, and though it’s happened in other instances, I had a huge panic attack in June. I went to the ER because my heart was racing, I didn’t know what I was doing or really where I was. All I really knew was I thought I was dying. Since then I had chest pains at night and sometimes during the day as a symptom of my anxiety. 

I’ve made this post to ask for advice. No, I do not think I have DID or anything like that because I don’t have symptoms other than (what I believe to be) derealization. 

Additionally, I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety, and Social Anxiety. I understand traumatic events can cause derealization, but this isn’t the first time I’ve experienced it. I remember vaguely having this in the past without it involving traumatic events. In need of advice on how to proceed, it’s been effecting my mental health and function (somewhat).",3,0,1753239420.0,mentalhealth,Dangerous_Drive285,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6y32q/derealization_tw_mentions_of_panic_death/,2025-07-25T09:58:18.560435

1m6zz4t,My dad is at the end of his life,"My dad is 67 and he has prostate cancer. We don’t know what stage it’s at yet but he can’t pee on his own anymore and he has other health issues that would complicate whatever treatment he’d need.

He used to live far away from me but I moved him to my town because he was evicted from his apartment for living in squalor. I wanted to him to be closer so I could keep a better eye on him and bring him back on track. 

He also has very serious mental health issues and he’s an alcoholic. He has become physically violent and gave me a black eye a few weeks ago. 

He can’t work because he had a massive stroke last year, he hasn’t had friends for years and I can barely stand being around him because he’s not a pleasant person. 

He has brought up wanting to die or letting the cancer “do it’s job” 4 times in the last few weeks. Today he told me I should start thinking about what I’m going to do with his furniture.

I don’t really know what to do anymore because I would feel the same way if I were in the hole he has dug for himself. I may sound harsh but I’ve known this moment would come my entire life. 

I find the whole situation extremely sad. At the end of the day he has a good heart and showed me love even though he has massive behavioural problems.

1m6xcir,Found out girlfriend has bumble (dating app),"English is not my first language. Please be kind, I am feeling really vulnerable. Looking for support and advice. Thank you.


I(M20) found out recently that my girlfriend (F 21) of almost two years has created a Bumble account recently. We are in LDR from last two months. I have been spiralling from the moment I found out that she created Bumble. I watched her slowly get distant, she didn't had time to talk to me suddenly, she stopped sending me reels, she stopped responding and finally on Saturday she stopped saying ""words of affirmation"" like I love you.

I asked her, I begged her to tell me what was wrong. I was scared to confront her about Bumble directly. I was anxious, lonely, scared and overwhelmed. Finally, I was not able to take it. I checked her recent following on Instagram, and i messaged the guy. I know that I have crossed a line by messaging the guy directly and I am extremely sorry for that but I just needed some answers. I didn't want her to lie to me again.

Everything came out, she has been talking to him for hours per day, chatting with him till 2-3 in midnight. I was begging her to talk to me for 5-10 mins. I was begging to atleast send me messages, good night messages, a few pics etc. But she didn't have time.


I called her and confronted her. She called me psychotic for messaging that guy directly, she called me disgusting and that I broke her trust. I don't understand why. She has been ghosting me from then.

I don't have an appetite from few days, I feel nauseous, my hands and legs keep shivering. I wasn't able to sleep yesterday night at all. I had bad anxious dreams, I felt like my heart was racing . I felt like I was not able to breathe. I feel nauseous. I feel guilty. I feel like I ruined a two year relationship.

1m730xq,"My therapist told me animals don’t feel anger, it’s humans only.","So this is my very first post, hello Reddit readers/writers, I enjoy your stories and comments so hopefully you can help me. Anyways let’s get into the meat and potatoes of this.

I have a therapist who told me during my session that animals don’t feel anger like humans do. He firmly believes emotions are only a human thing when we were talking about examples of emotions and human relations with their offspring. He basically told me not only do they not have emotion but they only emit aggressive behavior due to survival instincts only. He also made it clear with some example that supposedly he watched a video on YouTube of a momma lioness who was sickly due to eating something that upset her stomach and temporarily paralyzed her from protecting her cubs. Because of this, he claims all she was able to do was roar and her cubs were taken/eaten. Afterwards? He claims once she was able to move freely she didn’t seek revenge. Simply put, he claimed she just carried on and that was that.

Honestly though? Seriously? I really felt this was the first time I ever heard something like this and I personally felt offended and I felt like I was listening to an opinion of something that made no sense whatsoever! Am I overthinking/overreacting? The conversation that led up to this was just me clarifying some anger issues and how I felt I should change how I want to discipline my children rather than resorting to old standards used on me growing up. (Fellow belt and sandal subjectors hold your head up high. lol) But he was particularly on the anger aspect and basically made me feel it’s all of our fault as humans that we feel/have anger and no animal shows those kinds of emotions.

1m72jms,Overthinking kept me stuck for years here’s how I finally took back control of my mind.,"You don’t have to control your thoughts. You just have to stop letting them control you. Dan Millman

For most of my life, my brain felt like an enemy.

I overanalyzed everything conversations, decisions, even imagined situations. I was constantly in my head, replaying the past and fearing the future.
I wanted peace, but I didn’t know how to turn the noise off.

The worst part?
It made me feel powerless. Like I wasn’t in charge of my own mind.

Overthinking is the art of creating problems that weren’t even there.

I started reading more, reflecting more, and most importantly experimenting. Not with motivational videos or 10-hour routines. I wanted something practical that actually helped me stop spiraling and start thinking clearly again.

So I created a simple system daily actions to help me feel grounded, focused, and in control.

After a few weeks of real consistency, everything changed:

I didn’t freeze when making small decisions.

I stopped doubting myself every five minutes.

I could finally relax without guilt.

I began to trust my own mind again.


You can’t calm the storm, so stop trying. What you can do is calm yourself. The storm will pass.

Now when overthinking hits, I don’t panic. I reset. I respond. I don’t spiral like I used to.

Check my bio for a mind reset.

Small habits, when done consistently, beat bursts of motivation every time.

Stay steady. You don’t need to fix yourself just lead your mind back to calm, one day at a time. 💭

1m72i1s,what should i do now???,"I’m now approaching the second year of college. No new progress whatsoever or any major life changes so far. I really wanted to transfer by the next two years (because I thought it was realistic) but that dream is slowly becoming out of reach now. Not to mention I don’t have a job and I did try applying for work near me. I don’t have a car/can’t drive either but I’m bad with managing my time, so anything further than that will take a toll or trouble.

I thought of getting help on my own, but I’m not sure how to. My friends can only do so much or little, and my parents don’t really care.  I kept searching up places to get tested for some stuff (such as ADHD or OCD) but no luck. I heard of eVox brain mapping, but apparently the closest one offering it is an hour away from where I live (by car). It sounds a lot easier than going up to a psychiatrist or traditional therapy (I haven’t done either, but then again I never had the medical reason to).

1m6yk0f,"My life feels empty, and I can’t find a point.","I’m so tired of feeling the way I do 24/7, antidepressants (Lexapro) didn’t work and weed is the only thing that lets me feel anything other than stressed, angry, sad, or hollow. I honestly find it harder and harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel when I feel like a burden to everyone I interact with, almost always in downright ignored and it hurts. My dad is one of the only people who has shown me any love in recent years, but he also makes comments agreeing with, and sides with people who would like to see harm come to people in my group(s). My mother with outright ignore me unless it’s convenient for her to talk to me (I’m fairly sure she just sees me as another thing to lose money from). 

Recently some of my thoughts have been getting darker, and louder, and the urge to follow through on them is so overwhelming. Best way I can describe the majority is as “intrusive thoughts” in the sense that I’ll be driving and feel compelled to ram my car into a tree/building/person because, would anyone really care? And sadly I can only say that one would and when he passes away I’ll have no one left.

I’m scared. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like Ive been in a cell since elementary and that it’ll never really open again. Every once in a while I see some light and then I’m reminded that there’s really no point in me getting my hopes up, that I’m not getting out.

No need to worry for my safety as of yet I’m too weak to hurt myself even if I wanted to. The other reason is that I know if I did it would be spun into me being selfish and never caring for others and I don’t want to give my mother the satisfaction of that.

I'm sick and tired of her always being physical to get her way, calling me things like 'evil' or 'possessed' because I tend to break or bang on things to release my stress. It's gotten to the point that I've scratched myself and inflicted pain to distract me from these thoughts. I've kicked a massive hole in the wall, broke many items, and I'm still treated like shit. Crying gives me massive headaches and they don't subside until the next day. 

  
Literally yesterday she threw a bleach bottle at me and started acting bi-polar out of nowhere. Then she proceeds to get under my skin by calling me a full-grown woman preparing for marriage who can't do anything. (I'm 14 about to be 15) She always does this. She names me shit that gets to my head, I've been so used to her saying I don't know anything, used to her humiliating me in public, used to her acting irrational and get up in all my business. She scares away all of my friends. She's crazy and sometimes I feel like beating her stupid couch potato ass until she's on the floor crying like she's done to me in the past. I don't even care if I would go to jail. I've been a good child but she brings the worst out of me. I serious want to grab a knife or something and stab her.

1m721fh,i’m so tired of existing.,"So basically this peaked when I was somewhere in junior year of high school. Not sure why, but everything felt as if it changed since then. The trauma I endured from my dad took off a year prior, and my friend who I stuck around with for so long moved away the same year my health went downhill. There was no support system, but it was so obvious that I was struggling. I would disappear from school for at least a couple times per month and I accidentally nearly cried in front of my relatives (who I haven’t seen in a long time). 

Flash forward to senior year and everyone seemed to be cool with me, except from the inside I was still struggling. I had a friend group at this time and somewhat became friends with the cool people in my grade(?). At the same time, I was just so emotionally and mentally disconnected. Physically too. I would fall asleep at random times in class and I would walk extremely slow. My friend who moved away for a year came back but our relationship was complicated now. I was barely passing my classes and was also failing. I only received a warning and was told by at least someone that I looked so gloomy. The way I had acted that year was rough to look back on, I’d say I was manic at times. But no one else really questioned it, probably assumed that I was naturally that way.

My first year in college was a terrible start. I pretty much failed all of my classes except for I believe two out of maybe more than four. I felt awful for even my lab partner because I would show up late and exhausted in the morning. I only looked forward to my one class with a friend, which explains why I had only passed up until this point. I think I’ve received an academic warning from my college twice.

It’s my second year now, and completely nothing has changed. No license and no job. Classes and my fellowship were my priority, however I was struggling badly. I’d say it’s partly out of laziness, but I definitely tried sometimes. I think I feel alright now, but I feel like I’ve aged by a lot since then. It’s definitely hard to think properly, not when I need to recount what I did earlier to remember something. I’m currently taking “easier” classes—by easier I mean fully online classes. I could hardly sit still in class or stare at the clock waiting for class to end.

I’ve talked about my health to my friends but none of them seemed to be any help at all. Talking about my health to my mom meant nothing unless if it was an emergency, she would just say I’m lazy and I should get more sleep (ironically I find it hard to fall asleep half the time). I have thought of looking for a consultant of some sort and deal with my problems on my own, but factors such as transportation and what to say/address is pushing me away from trying.

1m71jor,"2 Years of OCD Struggles – No Money for Help, But I Want to Recover","Hi everyone,
I’m writing this because I honestly don’t know what else to do. For the last 2 years, I’ve been experiencing something that feels like OCD—mentally repeating words, replacing them, and getting stuck in thought loops. It started small, just a few repetitions here and there. But over time, it escalated to hundreds of mental repetitions daily.

Unwanted words or thoughts would pop up, and I felt the need to replace them with “better” ones in my head. If I didn’t, I’d feel uneasy until I did. It became exhausting. Even things like school and social interactions, which used to distract me, started making it worse. I felt like I couldn’t be present. My mind just wouldn’t stop.

Eventually, I started struggling with memory and focus. I used to be sharp—I could read and remember easily. But now, even when I study, I blank out in exams. Sometimes I can’t even recall short information just seconds later. It feels like the looping thoughts are interfering with everything.

I’ve also dealt with intrusive mental images that loop over and over again, especially when I’m trying to sleep. I used to fall asleep in seconds, now I lie awake for hours, mentally battling thoughts and images that won’t stop. It’s been deeply frustrating and draining.

I’ve dealt with a more physical version of this before—compulsively washing hands and worrying about contamination—but that felt manageable. This mental side of things feels so much more invisible and harder to cope with.

The problem is: I can’t afford therapy or medication. I’m from a lower middle-class background, and mental health treatment just isn’t accessible to me right now.

But I truly want to get better. I’m willing to work hard and stay consistent—I just don’t know where to begin without professional help.

So I’m asking:

If anyone has been through this, what helped you cope or recover?

Are there any free resources (YouTube channels, books, CBT worksheets, etc.) that helped you?

Where should someone in my situation start?


Even just hearing from someone who’s been through it would help.

I get close feeling happy but it doesn't feel the same. It started last year after I had done 1.5 months of keto and hadn't really lost any weight. Father struggling with being obese for a few years I was sad but I have a good life so I can't say I'm depressed. What I'm feeling isn't sadness it's more like flat feeling. Some days I can feel emotion more than other but it's some times. A friend of mine was saying something pretty sad to me but I couldn't feel anything barely it was super late at night. The later at night it is the more I feel numb. I do have pretty bad anxiety when it comes to being afraid of dying or being robbed. Before I would not go places because I was afraid of dying but now I go anywhere and I feel semi numb. I did some googling and it seems like I either have depersonalization or emotional numbness.

1m6tmgc,Building a non-cringe mental health app—do people even want one?,"I’m exploring an app idea around mental wellness x social space; emotional expression and identity for users, and I’m trying to understand how people relate to their mental states online (or don’t).

This isn’t a journaling, meditation, or therapy app, and I’m not building some daily self-care checklist either.

I’m curious about something else entirely:

What if your mental state could be a vibe you share without oversharing?

Not “Here’s my trauma,” but more like

“This is the energy I’m in right now.”

I’d love feedback on a few questions to understand emotional behaviour online:

1. Do you ever feel like your Instagram or Snapchat self is not how you feel mentally?
2. If you could show how you’re doing emotionally without having to explain it, would you?
3. What spaces (if any) do you currently feel emotionally safe or understood in?
4. How do you and your close friends signal that you’re going through it mentally? Is it memes, disappearing, or aesthetic posts?
5. Would you want a platform that helps you share and explore your emotional vibe without judgment or pressure?
6. What’s the biggest thing missing from current mental wellness apps? Do you think people would use a mental wellness app **i**f it wasn’t about advice, reflection, or meditation—but instead about expressing your current energy or mood socially?
7. When you’re feeling anxious, numb, or mentally stuck—what would *help* in an app that doesn’t feel like a lecture or to-do list?
8. What would make you come back to an emotional or vibe-based app daily, not just once when you’re sad?

**Bonus: If emotions could be a style, an energy, or a theme, would you want to express them?**

I just want to understand how people relate to their feelings online and whether they want something different from therapy apps or advice dumps.

Thanks in advance 🙏

1m70rvq,How do i learn to live like this?,"Hi. I recently turned 20, male. I’m not a native English speaker, so sorry if I make mistakes but I’ll do my best to explain clearly.



I think I might have a psychological problem.



I don't like the way my brain works. It's not just thinking, it overwhelms me every day. Even if I do a good job or have quality time I can’t stop thinking about things I can’t control. I stress over things that don’t even matter. It’s been like this since I was 15 or 16.



I tried to fix it by exercising, starting hobbies, meeting people online, and being “productive” But it never helped. Now I train, eat well, sleep well but I feel like I live like a robot. I get bored daily, and I’m completely alone. That gives my inner voice more space to upset and stress me out. I just can’t shut it down.



I don’t really know how to enjoy anything or let things go that bothers me. I’m calm and quiet, but sometimes I snap over small things, like realizing I can’t achieve something or stressing about some responsibility. It doesn’t happen often. I usually keep things inside, but when it builds up, I lose control. And it’s always over something meaningless.



I don’t want to hear my own thoughts anymore. Positive thoughts too, I don't want them. That’s why I listen to music all the time. I even try not to imagine anything while listening.



I am not suicidal but I don’t really want to live either. Not because life is bad or messed up or anything like that. On paper, I have a great life: a good family, many opportunities, and I’m generally a successful person. When I try to do something, I do it. But I have no motivation to keep going. I think it’s because I’m alone.



And I’m tired of thinking the same thoughts:

“Why do I feel this way?”

“I’ll feel better soon.”

“I’m good.”

“I’m bad.”



I just want the voices to shut up. Not to be positive, just to stop.



I’m not antisocial. I can talk to people, I can do silly stuff in public, and explain myself clearly. But I haven’t really made any friends, I guess. I always told myself not to complain because others have it way worse. But these days when I told myself it, I don't believe it inside.



Sometimes I wonder,

Am I mentally ill? Should I see a therapist? Would it even help?



My mom has seen this side of me. She supports me and says I could see a therapist but I don’t know if I want that either. My family knows I’m mostly alone. I joke about it and act like I don’t care, but the truth is, it hurts.



I feel like I’m some broken version of a human. I know I’m not but when you never see any proof, it’s hard to believe.



As a kid, I thought being alone and doing everything yourself was cool. I wanted to be “that guy.” Now I am that guy and honestly, it’s not worth it and I’m not cool either.  


Living every day like this, replaying mistakes, constantly comparing and competing, it makes me sick.



**So I’m asking:**

Is this just loneliness?

Am I actually mentally ill?

Can this be fixed?

How do I learn to live like this?

How can I find motivation to wake up tomorrow?

1m6l0er,Therapist broke all rules,"Therapist crossed every boundary — and no one’s listening. What can I do?”

I’m a male in my 30s. A few months ago I was in a vulnerable mental state — bipolar, officially disabled, going through a breakdown. I reached out for professional help. What I got was something else.

The therapist assigned to me not only violated basic ethical boundaries, but blurred the lines between intimacy and exploitation. There were moments that felt less like therapy and more like manipulation. She used her position of trust to control and destabilize me further — emotionally, sexually, and mentally. She knew I was in a fragile condition. She used that.

When I tried to speak up, the system shut down on me. I was discharged abruptly. The senior psychiatrist brushed me off. Promised help never arrived. I was treated like a burden, not a patient. My complaints were ignored.

I’ve already submitted formal complaints to her former university and institutions involved, but I feel like I’m yelling into a void. No real action, no accountability.

I know this might sound vague, but I’m trying to avoid legal backlash. I just want to ask:
Has anyone here dealt with abuse from a mental health provider? Did anyone ever fight it and win?
Where can I go when the people supposed to protect me are the ones who hurt me?

1m6qv0r,I'm having recurring thoughts of feeling like my life is worth less than someone elses or that I don't really deserve nice things,"I apologize for the vague title, I don't exactly know how to phrase this but I'll try to explain it and maybe someone here can help me understand it a little. I don't know whether this is a normal human thing to to feel or if I have something deep inside that needs taking care of, or maybe a mix of both.

Often times when I eat food or think of buying something for myself, I can't help it but to feel like ""why do *I* deserve this? Why not somebody else?"" It gets to a point where I genuinely feel bad about dining out or purchasing something nice for myself because not everyone can have it and who am I to enjoy luxuries? There are plenty of peoples in the world who can't afford such things and they'd be better off having it instead of me? Maybe they'd turn out to be geniuses that solve cancer and here I am being able to enjoy what others cannot. It just makes me feel so.. worthless, I suppose? 

It gets to a point where I sometimes just don't eat for a whole day and I don't feel bad about it. I know I'm hungry but my first instinct isn't to get something to eat but rather this entire thought process all over again. (I want to clarify that this isn't *just* about food, it's a general thing I feel. Food is probably just the simplest way I can explain it.)

It's such a complicated emotion for me. I'm typically pretty good at being able to pinpoint what I feel and why I feel a certain way, but not with this. I have a hard time grasping & explaining it, let alone finding a solution to it. It's been haunting me for as long as I can remember and I genuinely just don't know how to get rid of it.

I apologize if my explanation wasn't very clear. It's hard to put this into words for me. If you have any questions about anything - please feel free to ask. I'll try to clarify as much as possible. Thank you to whoever may be reading this! ♥

1m6qg2x,"I'm struggling with anger and dark thoughts, and I don’t know what to do.","I’m 16 male, and lately I’ve been struggling a lot with anger issues dark thoughts. 
(Sorry if my English sucks, as cliché as it sounds, its not my first language)
A little context about me, I grew up without a father and an emotionally, mentally and financially absent mother who would rather go on dates then attend to her kids, so I was pretty much stressed financially on how I could save up money to afford the things I need my, my relatives and grandma are very religious, but they're not any help to me.
So back to the topic after I gave a little context about me.

My mood shifts really fast one moment I’m okay, then suddenly I’m full of rage, then I'm okay again. I try to control it, but most of the time I can’t. I end up destroying stuff or just completely shutting down. I know it might seem like I'm overreacting about this situation as what the people around me said/told me, some would say that this was just a ""teenager phase"", but I can't help but overthink it. My temper gets worse as time pass. And when I'm angry I get thoughts of ending it there or self harm, but I manage to just keep it as a thought. I don’t want to assume anything, I don’t have money to get myself checked up, or should I really get checked up. Everyone I've ever talked this about just called it, like I said awhile ago a ""teenager phase"" or that I'm overreacting and making such a big deal out of it. I've also had a hard time sleeping too, the most simple thing can make me angry and overthink it the whole night resulting to me not having proper sleep. I’ve had people tell me I’m intimidating or a problem, and sometimes I wonder... what if they’re right? What if I really am the problem? I feel guilty for the people I hurt, but also angry because I don’t feel heard, why? My relatives or family would pull the religious thingy, I'm not an atheist, I do believe there's God, I'm just tired of hearing the same religious thing, its not helping at all.
I’m scared of the person I might become if this keeps going. I don’t want to be cruel or harmful but I feel like I'm drowning and no one notices unless I explode. When I try to express myself I just ended up getting scolded, or getting called weak and that I should ""man up"".
I don't know what to do I hate this I don't want to hurt anyone anymore, I just want this to end.

1m6viaz,I'm just sick and tired.,"Tldr at the end

Im a guy, and I'm sick and tired 
of just being taken as someone useful and lovable only for what I can do for people.

I've been trying to date for years now and have had absolutely zero response as of now, zero. Now here are a few disclaimers, I know I'm not older relationship, I know that no woman is owed me anything, and I know I need to do the things I need to do to make me and attractive person but I'm just tired now. 

I want a genuine relationship, I don't want sex, I don't want a woman for her body, I want her for her. I want a relationship so I can spoil her, so I can come for her when she's hurting, when I can surprise her with gifts you never thought she would be able to get, so I could also serve her, and do my best and make her the happiest woman in the world. That's all I want. 

Countless people have told me that I'm a good looking guy, with great characteristics and great moral values. I've been told by women that I'm a very respectable guy, a genuine person, extremely trustworthy, a joy to be around, a great friend, 'the only person they trust', that I'm so sweet, or so caring, and all of that. 
And I admire that people see that in me because I used to be a terrible person but Jesus did a 180 on my life.

So I'm going to continue being who God made me to be, but it seems that anytime it comes to a relationship it changes. I've had women who have used me for things like emotional support, assistance with grades (although I never cheated for them), a vent source, etc and after they've gotten what they needed from me, (feeling better or got their A), they rarely or even never associated with me again. I've been rejected more times than I've gotten a paycheck at my job.

I always hear that some girl will be lucky to be with me, or that one day some hypothetical person would finally accept me, but that never happens.

I have no one to talk to really for this in real life as I'll get scorned and mocked, I also look online then for some support for guys who went through similar experiences. But all I see is that it's always, ""YOUR AN INCEL"", or ""YOU NEED TO DO MORE"", or ""YOU HATE WOMEN AND THINK THEIR OBJECTS"" or basically telling them to cope and they don't deserve to be feeling the way they feel.

How can I think a woman is an object when I don't want her for sex? But I want her to serve her and make her happy with no strings attached? 

How am I an incel or some terrible person when I get so many comments particularly from women praising my character? 

I hate being labeled a creep, when all I do is gently start a wonderful conversation with a friend whom I later ask out, the same friends will be praising my character, and I get rejected. But then the angering part is the same women will go online and talk about how they're alone or no one wants them, except the creeps out there who want to harm women. 

When I've never done that, I've never hit a woman. I strive to be the most respectful I possibly can, I'm not perfect, but I strive. When I express my desire in a relationship, all that gets thrown at me is that I want to use women, when that's obviously not the case. But when women want to use me for stuff that benefits them it's no problem with that.

Tldr:
I'm tired of being labeled as a great person but then in dating no one wants me for me. Then I'm being grouped into the same bubble as people who genuinely hate women when me/guys like me express their hurt. But it's perfectly fine for me to get used.

Another eye-opener was discovering that anxiety is my most frequent emotion. I had no idea how often I was actually experiencing it until I saw it tracked over time.

1m6v6xt,If my emotional state was a place.,"If my emotional state was a place it would be a huge foggy forest surrounding a huge plot of open land, also very foggy, with hills…ups and downs, the field so empty and big that as you stand in the middle you would be unable to see the trees surrounding it. The colours would be very unsaturated and the sky would be grey, covered with rain clouds that are about to burst into a storm at any moment, but the field is still eerily quiet. The place would give you an eerie feeling, one of discomfort but strong familiarity, like being inside there is unsafe but leaving is even more risky. If you were able to walk through the forest you may feel the trees whispering to you, but you can’t make out what they’re saying. Everywhere you go looks the same, you seem to be getting lost, you should be panicking but the air around you feels like nothingness, you aren’t in any immediate danger, but staying here for too long can’t be good, but how far will you have to go to escape it? You may speak to a couple of kind trees along the way, you may find an area without any fog, you may smile and laugh, but the feeling in the air never goes away. Nothing that makes you feel connected to the space, you are truly all alone where you are. Someone might be yelling at you from afar but you find it hard to hear them, is that a glass wall you see at the edge of the forest? Who is speaking to you from outside of it? You may try to communicate with them but they can’t hear you through the glass, they won’t listen, and even if they could, would they understand? You can tell something isn’t right here, but the sun brings motivation and without any, everything seems too much, will melancholy follow you forever? But just as you think that, she seems to be swept away by the wind, the wind that doesn’t bring peace but nothingness. You aren’t happy in this place, and you aren’t necessarily sad, you keep moving but as you touch the trees you feel as though your hand might go straight through it. You don’t want to be here, you have faint memories of the world beyond the glass walls but they’re running away from you, is this glass bullet proof? How hard will it be to smash it?

1m6zqj8,Fear of abandonment,"I talk to another member on here and we where able to commiserate on several issues that really help me identify a lot of what was going on with me and a lot the problems I have making new friends or any friends. I have a very deep fear of abandonment. So much so I cannot even allow a new person who might become a friend to try because first little sign I do something to push them away because I scared of being hurt. I think the main reason I so isolated in my is because I create these self fulfilling prophecies over and over again where I do something either knowing or subconsciously to trip up the other person to stop them from coming closer or even wating to stick around at all and then I become mad when. They have the audacity to reject me. I mean there is more too it this is kind the summary of it. 

I also approach people with the hope they may be the answer and salvation to save me from whatever pit of isolation I am and I keep hoping ad I am reaching out from my prison of shadows that this next one is going to be it. And so I desperately try to cling to people and I always present myself as needy and and broken and the stuff that nobody wants because nobody wants a soul sucker like that in their life it's because I'm so desperate to get out of this pit of Hell that I am in that I would want you to commit to me right now in any kind of capacity not like as a friend for life you know or if we were dating marry me like 5 seconds after we say hello kind of thing and I don't even know how to talk to people well I'm introducing myself for two for the first time except giving them all my BS. I literally live part of my life in the lyrics of the song Wonderwall where they say maybe you're going to be the one that saves me and that's how I approach a lot of people that this relationship this friendship that might possibly happen between us is going to be my salvation from loneliness and my chance to stop living on the sidelines and watching like an audience member to life and I actually be in the middle of life for once and that's how I approach everyone.

And I just very much want to know how to make all of this go away where I can be okay right as I am if I happen to make friends with you that we can be friends and I don't look there's another soul I need to suck dry to make myself feel good about my emptiness inside because it's gone and I want to know how to make that all happen

1m6zm4u,How to get a job despite depression?,"Hello everyone. I'm hoping to get some advice from people with experience in depression or similar conditions.

I don't have an exact diagnosis. During a week-long evaluation for military service fitness, I was diagnosed with schizotypal disorder. However, this felt like it was given purely for formality after a couple of short conversations with a psychiatrist, and frankly, I don't trust that diagnosis at all. A psychotherapist I saw for about half a year suspected I had depression and Borderline Personality Disorder.

My condition has improved somewhat since I stopped therapy about 4 years ago, but I still struggle with performing many basic actions. I'm enrolled in a distance learning program. Honestly, less for the degree itself and more so I don't disappoint my father, who is paying for it. I also occasionally work part-time in delivery when I'm feeling better.

The reason I'm writing is that I urgently need to get a stable job. This isn't about my own comfort; it's about the literal survival of a friend. She cannot work and is in a situation where her physical survival technically depends on my ability to help her. If I don't, her only other options could lead to a terrible, or even fatal, outcome. I simply can't let that happen.

But because of my mental state, the very attempt to look at job listings or make calls leaves me completely paralyzed. It’s not a panic attack; it's a total inability to force myself to act. I am fully aware that I have no choice, yet I can't break through this wall. I just keep procrastinating and avoiding reality, knowing that every day I wait increases the risk of an outcome I'll regret for the rest of my life.

My question is this: If you've experienced something similar, how did you overcome this feeling of paralysis when you had to do something necessary, like find a job? What can help break through this wall of helplessness when you can't even perform the simplest action?

I apologize if this is poorly worded or not the right place for this question. Thank you for reading.",0,3,1753244113.0,mentalhealth,PaladinGoat,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6zm4u/how_to_get_a_job_despite_depression/,2025-07-25T09:58:19.596396

1m6zdt4,It was never my responsibility,"Since I was a teenager, life demanded me to become my mother’s caregiver due to her bipolar disorder, I didn’t have any options nor choice.

I know that most people think “It’s so simple, just make sure she’s taking her meds and she’ll be fine”. And I really hope things were just like that, but that’s not the case for me.

It’s true that I only have to make sure she’s taking her meds when she’s stable, but every time I hand those pills to my mother, I can’t help but remember all those times I’ve trusted she’s taking her meds by herself, just to see her having a relapse in a matter of weeks, or those times where she “took” her meds in front of me, just to throw them in the bathroom afterwards. I can’t stop thinking about the hypervigilance I find myself in, listening every of her moves while trying to identify if there’s any changes in her actions that tell me she’s on a manic episode again. I keep dreaming that my mother is having those episodes and feeling desperate cause I know there’s nothing I can do to fix it right away, and then I wake up stressed, not knowing if an episode is happening or not. 

Whenever I realize she’s actually having a relapse, it’s impossible for me not to give up my own life. I stop caring about my job, my future. I lose interest, just want to sleep and never wake up again.
I hate that I was given such a responsibility that I wasn’t prepared to take, and now every time this cycle repeats, I can’t help but fall apart.

Maybe I’m just making a big scene out of something small, but her relapses mean to me a strong “Forget you have a life, cause your only role is to take care of her”. And I really hate that, I no longer want to think that way. 

I’m turning 23 tomorrow, but it definitely won’t be a day to celebrate, just a day to punish myself for allowing a relapse to occur again, and feeling guilty for not being strong enough to keep things in order.

1m6ytn4,"Feeling despair, incompetent, complete failure.","Background: I’m in medical residency and my residency program itself is good but it’s filled with few toxic residents who just make the whole work dynamic trash. They have their little clicks and I’m frankly very alone. I also moved from a huge city to this small town program and have faced/still facing a lot of adversity but I have just been chalking it off, thinking to myself that I’ll get out of here soon and I don’t need to be here anymore. 

Well I’m in my senior year now and I applied to few fellowships last year. Although I wasn’t desperate for any fellowship, it was more like if I land one great, if not then that’s ok as I will just apply to jobs. Well I didn’t get any of the fellowships and the only one I had a shot at, informed me today that they aren’t taking anymore fellows due to some internal affairs.

1m6ty9w,life is so bleak now,"heya. I'm not sure if I want help or just needed to rant. advice or opinions would be appreciated though.

whilst not new, I've hit a new low in life. everything's just so bad. excuse typos, my hands are shaking as I type this. nothing interests me, I'm tired and emotional, and have no one to turn to.

for starters, no matter what I do, I just feel empty. all my past hobbies are just so boring. nothing is fun. everything's dull. I've been staying in my bed everyday, even rotting my brain with social media doesn't stimulate anything. like I'm just going through the day. sleeping to pass time because what else can I do? I've tried picking up hobbies but it's just more of a chore for me.

also important to note, this worsens with the fact that im just so damn tired all the time. no matter how much I sleep, I'm tired. I have no energy to do remotely anything and this disrupts my life. even laying in bed is tiring. I'm just so exhausted.

I guess being tired also affects my mood since I've been really emotional lately. my mood changes so irregularly. I find myself crying at any little thing. I know I'm rather sensitive, but this is new. I think I'm overwhelmed, and because of that, I cry more? other than being tired, I think I'm just sad in general. I can't find anything in my life to be happy for and I wake up every morning with dread in my chest. the concept of living through another day just gives me this feeling of foreboding doom.

I can't talk to anyone either. all my relationships with people end because of me. they never last long, and I'm the one to break it off. this is a whole new can of worms, but to put it simply, I've been called intense and overly insecure. like I need reassurance that they actually like me. I'd only cling to them and will get jealous if I catch them even talking to anyone else. imagine a controlling girlfriend, but as a friend. if I sense even a slight change in their behavior, I'll overthink and isolate myself. it's as if I'm seeing if they'll chase me. if they don't, then we just... drift apart.

also, I think it's important to note I jump from one person to another. I hate groups of people. I think it's about having to share attention with others. I think because of my desperation for a close bond, I romanticize the person in my head. and when they don't behave the way I wish they would? they're suddenly the devil. I go from loving someone to loathing them so easily.

I don't think there's anything wrong with me. in seeing professional help but I don't think it's working. I don't know how I want to be helped. I don't think I want help. that's just too tiring. I just want things to stop.

it's not that I hate my life. I'm blessed. people would kill to have my life. but things would be so much easier if I were just... dead. I envy characters who die in media. it's so peaceful. after death there's nothing. I want that. if only it wasn't selfish.

1m6t18c,Cold turkey Paroxetine… started back… stopped again — need advice :(,"Hey everyone,
I’m hoping someone out there has been through something similar and can offer advice or just help me feel a little less alone.

I’ve been diagnosed with severe PTSD, anxiety, and depression about a year and half ago. Which I knew I always had it. I was SA at a young age (13) and that’s where it all begun. About 7 months ago, my doctor prescribed me Paroxetine 10mg, and it actually helped. But after a while, I started going to weekly therapy and felt like it was really making a difference, so I decided to stop taking the medication—cold turkey (I now know that wasn’t the safest choice and should have talked to the pharmacy technician or my doctor before doing so).

Unfortunately, I recently slipped into a major depressive episode, and a big part of it is because I had to stop therapy due to financial issues. On Friday, I decided to start Paroxetine again at the original 10mg dose. But then I started researching and realized restarting at full dose after a break might not be the best idea. So on Saturday, I took just 5mg instead by cutting the pill in half. But by Sunday, I got scared again after more reading and just stopped completely (I know, it’s a mess).

Right now, my brain feels super foggy, I’m really down, and the anxiety jitters are constant. I’m not sure if this is from restarting/stopping again or just everything piling up. I guess I’m wondering:
	•	Has anyone gone through something similar with starting and stopping Paroxetine?
	•	How long did the foggy feeling and sadness last?
	•	Should I try to ride it out, or talk to my doctor again about restarting safely?

But the truth is, I’m tired. Not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. Some days, even getting out of bed feels like a mountain to climb. And yet, no one really notices, because I’ve gotten so good at hiding it.

1m6xmno,I´m not okay.,"I wanna start of with that I mean no dissrespect to people with actual mental conditions and such, I feel for you and this is only my way of asking people who might know something about my mental state.

Now. I´m not sure if i´m as mentally there as people think. Is it normal to feel like you want to laugh uncontrollable and if feel like your heart is gonna beat out of your chest, is it normal to shake and have almost like ticks of facial muscles moving. I do have a bit of a story of self deprication but I don´t think these are related, just thought to mention that if somebody might´ve wondered. My mind is blank and yet completely full.

I don´t practice self harm in the typical way, but things like scratching my face hardly and ripping at my skin sometimes helps with focusing.  I´m an avid nailbiter and I´ve heard that Anxiety is usually a big reason for that. But, I can´t NOT have anxiety, it´s like it´s a part of me. I can be social with others of course but my biggest feeling is always that i´m gonna dissapoint them with my weirdness and quirks. I hate making people worry for me, I have a very caring family who always helps out when it´s most needed, so bringing up these sorts of issues and thoughts would just make them worry, and their lives is full enough of that as it is. And why worry about me. I know me writing this seems kind of strange, but I feel like this helps. Getting my thoughts I´ve kept locked finally being able to peak out.

I´m a very passioned ""artist"" who loves developing my skills. So much that sometimes my mind just isn´t there, it´s wandered off to something else. I don´t think I´m gonna hurt someone, that´d probably make me hate myself to an unimaginable degree considering that the few times I have I wallow in sorrow at their doorstep begging for their forgivness and asking if they´re alright.

And i´m gonna be honest, there have been times where my mind in the back of it whispers these horrible things, ""Why don´t you push them in? Why don´t you jump out of the car door"" It just scares me, luckily the front part of my brain is sane.

I feel shifty and unpredictable, almost as if I could use force on something or someone but immediately that thought is followed by the amount of guilt and sorrow for the person I´d feel. I´m definetly not a sociopath or psychopath, I care deeply for people. I just feel like i´m not there. Doesn´t help either that I´m prone to anger issues over small things, especially when people call for me and I answer and they continue, or when Things keep falling, but after I go through my anger episodes I alwayas feel so sorry for the people I hurt. Life just feels like a blur, like i´m a never ending waver of dissapointment and disstain. People say that you NEED to socialise and be a normal person, but at the same time, where´s the fun in that. It just feels like a world without me would be doing just fine, maybe even better. But, atleast theres hope in what my ideas bring to the table, and I have hope that my ideas can give myself a bit of a reason for being here and wasting space.

I've recently started seeing the nicest guy i have ever met, he is so sweet and I really like him. He knows about my mental health a little and I told him I wanted to hurt myself recently, which he helped with and distracted me from relapsing.

Obviously, i relapsed but i am mainly just worried because he's never seen me before when I relapsed or my arms. I dont want to freak him out or anything but I wanna keep seeing him.

I am mainly just worried he may be repulsed by my relapse as earlier today he called S/H....'stupid'. It may of been a joke, but it was serious to me

1m6xjy6,Can’t break the cycle in half .,"I (25 F) can’t seem to break the cycle and it sucks . I do the same thing every day and every few days I fuck up and someone ends up mad at me. I’m so sensitive that I can’t handle people being upset with me . 

Backstory ok , I work at a school. I help the teacher with whatever they need and I somehow suck at that . I come from a long line of teachers and have always told myself I will never be a teacher because kids aren’t my vibe anymore . I just can’t tolerate this generation what so ever, I’ve made mistakes and gotten yelled at by parents at this place I just can’t do it . 

I’ve been through some stressful things but this is so insanely stressful , I go to work and do that . Then I come home and play video games or watch tv , stay up until late at night then get very little sleep and do it all over again . 

Being a teacher or teachers aide is incredibly hard , I try to restrain myself from being too harsh to the kids but they just push all the buttons . I’m generally not a loud person but sometimes I get loud and I know I’m not supposed to but so  much is going on my head and in the world it’s too much. 

Like the title says I can’t break this cycle of fucking up and expecting tomorrow to be better . Today a parent came to the class to pick up their kid and I forgot to tell the teacher . It was a very stupid mistake and the teacher was rightfully mad . 

Sometimes I think I’m so insanely stupid that I just can’t anymore . Idk how else to word that . I try to get through with music but then I got to work and it happens all over again . I’m so bad at my job but I need this job for now . I just hate myself right now ya know . I wish I was better at this but I’m not . 

I can’t stop making mistake after mistake after mistake , I try but again it’s so hard . I have friends and I talk to em yet still feel so lonely .

I’m 23 - haven’t historically taken great care of myself and I’m starting to lose my mind. I’ve had to quit without a notice period from my new job and am struggling to even leave the house after finally breaking down about a small lump on my left calf and aching leg pain in the same leg which I’ve had for almost two years. In the span of three days I went to A&E/Doctors/GPs four times because I started to have breathing issues suddenly and chest pains, all which have now gone and I’m sure were a prolonged anxiety attack. I also found a small lump in my neck which the GP assured me is a tiny swollen lymph node. But the aching pain in my leg remains. The GP checked and laughed and assured me again that the small unchanged lump in my leg could be nothing but a cyst and is entirely un -related to the leg pain - but still no reason for the leg pain!!

1m6wpcl,"My roommates are joking about a personal detail I drunkenly shared, and it’s spiraling out of control. How do I handle this?","I’m a 24-year-old guy living with three male roommates. They’re great people, and we’ve always had a solid relationship, helping each other out and getting along well. Last Saturday, we went out drinking and came back home. I got pretty drunk and talkative, and we were chatting about random stuff. I don’t remember how the conversation got there, but I blurted out that I have an “average” penis, mentioning I’d measured it at 5 inches. I didn’t realize how personal that was until it was too late.

The next day, my roommates started making lighthearted jokes about it. I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable discussing it further, but later that day, I found out one of them had recorded me saying it and shared the video in our group chat (just the four of us). I was shocked and humiliated. Since then, they keep bringing it up and teasing me every chance they get. I’m terrified they might joke about it with others, and I don’t know how I’d handle that. I’ve been so anxious that I’ve stopped eating and sleeping properly. My thoughts are getting really dark, and I’m struggling to figure out how to move forward.

1m6rl8q,Why do i get random anxiety in my stomach during the day?,"Edit: if this isnt the right place to ask this question please let me know! 

Okay so im first gonna explain the problem im having, then a little about me to give some background.

For the last couple of weeks (maybe months, i havent really been keeping track of when this started, but definitely not a year) ive been having random anxiety in my stomach? Im not english, so i dont know the right words, but it feels like a really nervous feeling, like im about to walk into a room of strangers and i have to talk to them, or when youre about to drop (or dropping) on a rollercoaster, or like im feeling really homesick (even tho sometimes when it happens im already home?). That feeling, i randomly get it in my stomach for a few seconds, and then its gone. Im not doing anything special in the moment, just lying in bed, talking to a friend/family, standing still, doing something, like it happens randomly. I dont think any bad thoughts in the moment or something, nothing is happening. But i just get that feeling and i feel so uneasy afterwards, in the moment i want to puke, and when its over i feel sad or something, like im missing something, i dont really know how to explain it. I just feel uneasy afterwards , like i have to drink alot of water right that second, but im not thirsty. Sorry for the overexplaining, but i really dont know the right words for it...

Now about me a little, my mental health is doing fine! Better than ever even! I graduated from highschool last year, i hated it there, i was doing okay, i had sort of friends so i wasnt alone, but i hated school. Now ive finished my first year of uni and ive never been happier. Ive met loads of new, real friends, my classes are interesting and im passing all my exams, im honestly actually very happy and so much more confident. I can talk to people so much easier right now, im more confident in myself and what im capable of, my mental health is really doing great right now! I am kind of stressed for the next year, because i also feel like im kind of an imposter at my study (physics) because i feel like im not super smart , but like i passed all my exams so im sure ill do fine, and this feeling is common i heard. But im also really really excited for next year! So that cant be it i think (and when i have these 'episodes' most of the time im not doing anything uni related, or thinking about it or anything). Life at home is great, i have a very loving family and 3 best friends of 10 years, so theres nothing really going on that could be causing these anxiety 'episodes'. I do have intrusive thoughts, but im getting better at ignoring them and like not thinking like that. But my intrusive thoughts have been so much worse before, so they cant be the reason im suddenly having these 'episodes'. Im at a healthy weight, i dont exercise (i used to swim competitively) anymore, but ive stopped like a year ago and back then i didnt have these feelings in my stomach. I eat my veggies, i eat enough, not too much, not that unhealthy, like what else could be the cause?? Ive never been diagnosed with anxiety or any of the sort, i dont have panic attacks, im not using meds, never have.

Really long story short, im having these random feelings of anxiety in my stomach during the day and i dont know whats causing them and what i can do about them. Does someone recognize this?

1m6rjv8,Why the hell are therapists so lifeless and why do any meds never work?,"

Ive got major anger issues and that's no doubt about it to where at some points I've randomly snapped and kicked someone's head in. As a person I'm fairly shy and observant to where a few social workers actually thought I was a sociopath at some point.

all my life I've had workers come in such as when I was 4 I remember being in the living room hiding under a blanket while 2 women (social workers I think they were) tried interacting with me and such.

In the UK mental health is practically down the gutter and services are strained to the life of them however when my mum got a hold of me with a therapist that she knew personally who was a family friend I've never heard of I tried to a agree. But I'm extremely skeptical of them anytime I've interacted with such I'm treated like a child and I get it im fairly young but 
I HATE when I get treated as such and not a intellectual being.

in my past experience I've actually made 2 therapists practically quit or given up entirely on me (and before anyone jumps to conclusions no I haven't done anything wrong or appalled them) and honestly they drained the life out of me. And I don't take any pride in it seriously I understand what they were trying to do.

BACK TO WHEN MY MUM GOT ME A THERAPIST.

This therapist has a long enough experience of dealing with my family she had dealt with my mum and my brother who they both shine few properties into me so she figured that it would help me because I had asked for a therapist because at the time I was depressed to where I almost OD many times however by the time she got ahold of her it was a YEAR LATER after my whole ordeal. Now when I first got set up with an appointment it was over video call which in my opinion felt lifeless and sucky ESPECIALLY in a home where people could possibly hear everything happening. During this whole thing the questions were so bland and lifeless like average chit chat my voice was becoming so monotone (if that's how I could say) her also litro reason of becoming a therapist was oh I got bullied at school for a little bit which to me was ""oh okay"" and we kept going back and forth with the most lifeless conversation and I didn't open up because there was nothing to open up to however to my whole ordeal that's how I remember.

1m6kug4,Friends ghosted me that is affecting my mental health,"This summer I was looking forward to going outdoors with my friends and doing some sort of fun activities. However, my friends seem not to value me outside of school activities. For some context, I've had very bad experiences with friendships people have ghosted me in the past and never bothered to reach out, I have messaged them countless times to the point I am crying but still they seem heartless and do not care. I had a ""friend"" who told my old bullies that they bullied me and well they threatened me and claimed they didnt do that. That situation caused a 2 day shutdown and constant doomscrolling. Now talking about the future it looks as if my current friends are turning their backs on me. I met Berta this school year and everything was going well. I found common topics with her. I could talk with her about my favorite shows, my diagnosis and just random stuff but now she doesnt even bother to message me back. I did a bit digging and found out that she is online quite frequently. Shes either playing Roblox or idk doomscrolling but she has no time to even message me back? I dont even want to ask her why shes doing that because I know from past experiences that I will either be ignored again or cursed out.  My friend Tobias who I know for 4 years, to whom I've shared the most spontaneous thoughts, all my feelings towards my other friends, the school gossip just ghosted me. I met him at the graduation and confronted him about this. He said that he was playing basketball with his brother for 2 hours. Ok, I guess I understand why you didnt reply the day before the graduation. But what about all the weeks you ignored me? You either play video games or at very least go outside to play basketball, a ""Hi"" wouldn't hurt. And now when it comes to my friend Darius well I never initiated a contact with him outside of school, although he does reply when I message him.  We mainly joke around so I never really bothered him with how I am feeling with my friends' chooses. But I feel like he's the only hope for something to blossom this summer. I would really want to ask him why are our friends ignoring me and not wanting to go out with me. Perhaps he could get an answer from Berta explaining why shes doing that. Obviously I have other friends but they are either online friends or i dont envision them going out with me. My friend who is into chemistry(even got 100 from exam)  would much rather solve problems or watch documentaries than hang out with anyone. I have talked about this issue with my psychologist countless of times but now that its summer I feel confused. So I hope you can provide some sort of solution to my issues. Btw, I dont know if my friends are doing this on purpose, my social skills can be quite, well awful. I dont really get social cues but I still want to figure this out.

1m6qeuq,Unsure how to change.,"Hello, my first post here I think.

I like playing video games to kind of lose myself from my worries, therapist says it’s good to have these outlets - however I always find myself playing games where I don’t have to put headphones on so I can listen to a podcast/YT video in the background. I have been doing this for almost a year now straight - to the point where I feel as if I cannot do anything other than listen to other audios and play stuff with no noise. I want that outlet again, to get lost in another world - do I just do this kind of cold turkey style of putting the damn phone down and trying or could there be a method to this?

I understand this is a completely idiotic thing to be concerned about mental health wise however it is deeply affecting me and causing hours after work to just feel like
I’m ruining my wellbeing by doing this over and over again. Apologies.",2,1,1753218939.0,mentalhealth,feralboylover,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6qeuq/unsure_how_to_change/,2025-07-25T09:58:19.596396
1m6vi8m,I feel emotionally neglected with a lot of responsibility. I feel like I dislike my life.,"People around me seem a little crazy sometimes. Their decisions and actions usually are not in my benefit and I feel neglected. I am not the favorite child. 

I feel kinda void. I spent and have been spending most of my free time / time in general to myself since I was 12. 

My parents think it’s better and things are cured when in reality I’m still unhappy. 

I wish that I had my perfect life. I had friends closer in age to me, I wish I had someone to be comfort to me, and I wish I had people to hang out with. 
I wish I was a better person and didn’t make upsetting mistakes. 

My life has legit been one negative thing after the other. I feel like I exist mostly for other people. It’s hard. 

I love my younger friends who I want to be responsible for, I love my older friends (long distance/ online) who check up on me, I love my stuff like my collectables and clothes.. but honestly having that is great but I still feel emotionally void. I feel like I’m missing something. 

I also feel evil for some reason. It’s impossible especially now to feel anything but evil. I have indeed made a ton of mistakes in my 18-19 years. It was not something I think I should have been making. 

In May and after people didn’t have care for me. I returned from the psych ward (that was extremely traumatic because my roomate was sexually assaulted and the dude tried to corner me).. but after that I just laid down in my room. Genuinely 98% or my summer has just been that. 

Believe me I’ve tried to make relationships with my parents and brother but it’s just hard. I hang out with my younger friends but it isn’t the same as having older friends. 

Man this is ass. Idk why I crave it so much. Like I want a friend group to hang out with and a friend group and I feel motivated by. I wanna have fun. 

Instead I just feel scared and guilty and I feel like I have a lot of responsibilities pushing me down into a depression.

1m6uum9,It all started with an casual accidental cut,"It feels weird and abnormal to talk about this to strangers on the internet, but I need to get it off of my chest.   

So for context on what started it:   
I was moving furnitures around and I used cardboard boxes to do so, while moving against a cardboard ledge my arm more specifically my wrist rubbed along the sharp side of the cardboard multiple times without me even feeling much, when I finished placing it how I needed it to be I felt a sharp burning on my wrist, it was all scratched with some long red trails.  
Now while being home and in my bed, I inspected my wrist at how the cuts were going all over the back of the wrist and then these dark thought flooded my mind and made me want to feel what it's like to do the thing so I did lightly at first, then I went harder, and started doing actual slashes movements from one side to the other until I started bleeding at one of the cuts then stopped because I can't stand seeing myself bleeding(hemophobia), I always felt some of these strange urge to do insane stupid shits like cutting myself but now I actually did it and I'm just feeling weird, now it burn so bad and it's making red visible scratches, now I'm on my bed writing with my wrist burning, I feel ashamed of myself for that.    
I think I did it because I feel like physical pain is way more manageable than mental pain, but I'm not sure   

It's my first time talking about such thing, so I apologize if what I depicted is too graphic, if so I will edit as necessary.

I do this in fear of unknowingly sexually assaulting someone, like if someone sits on my bed I'll fear that they will have sat on that specific spot of semen, a thing that I could've prevented if I just didn't masturbate, same thing with the sink, the towels and the overall surfaces that I have touched. I fear of hurting someone this way and even though it's completely irrational I can't stop myself from cleaning freaking everything!

1m6uhqh,Why do I hate everything I make? Am I mentally stable?,"Recently I've been trying a lot of things because I've always felt like I wasted all my life and have no talents or future in store for me...

I tried doing ART... Mostly digital but also traditional on paper... The best I got was a few dysproportioned mugshots... I can't draw full body no matter how many hours I spend analysing or referencing OR TRACING real world examples or anime characters I like... So I hate all the art I've made... I'm like those 16 year old ""bEgGiNnEr ArTiStS""... Except actual 14 year olds and 16 year olds are out here making masterpieces and full manga pannels meanwhile I can't even draw a good looking character. I hate everything I do... The only reason I never threw away or deleted my work was because a friend of mine begged me to keep them (but all they do is make me feel embarrassed and disgusted.)

I tried making music (through FL)... And while, yes, I did improve... The only improvement that I managed to get is using FL slicer and sampling rabdom sounds I can find (and making shitty beats out of them) and adding reverb... Meanwhile some russian 15 year olds make a living off of selling beats... I like my works in FL one day but when I go listen to them in the morning I instantly get embarrassed and wanna bury my head under the sand.

I tried gamedev... But I could barely writr any functional lines of code and the finished product (held together with sloppy code, janky stolen sprite sheets and worthless tutorials) just made me have breakdowns over breakdowns...

It seems like nothing I ever do is good enough to me. I hate everything I make and everything I put my time into... And it's not like I have a good academic track record to back me up so I'm scared I'll not be able to get employed in the future. So that begs the question...

1m6oj25,I HATE MY BEST FRIEND but I can't stop talking to him,"I want to reduce communication with my friend, but I still can’t bring myself to tell him. We’ve been friends since elementary school, we were both bullied at school, I guess that’s what brought us closer. We were basically very similar for a long time, the same sense of humor, similar hobbies. We live in neighboring buildings. But then everything changed. I became a calm, withdrawn 19-year-old guy who just loves watching movies and walking in nature and studying animals. I just like living, although sometimes my anxiety disorder gets in the way of that. He, on the contrary, became sociable, toxic, started hanging out at parties, drinking, smoking, and he’s also a Nazi and constantly has complaints about everyone. He literally has no tolerance for everyone around him and an almost complete lack of emotional empathy. Sometimes he says things that evoke disgust, for example, that he’s ready to kill for money, that he likes to manipulate others, that charity is a show, no one will do good for no reason. He laughs at disabled people on the streets. I hate him, but at the same time he is my friend and the closest of my friends, of which I only have two. I have fun hanging out with him, discussing movies, but in his presence my mouth shuts up and I don't feel disgusted like before. It's as if I'm being replaced. For example, I decide not to communicate with him anymore, but then he calls and I become an obedient dog and am happy to go somewhere with him, and I tell myself that I'm exaggerating and he's a normal guy. Sometimes, when something doesn't work out, I hear his voice in my head, how he humiliates me, laughs at my failure. I also have similar dreams. What should I do, I want to reduce communication with him, but not lose him completely, let him be an old friend, but not a best friend with whom I communicate every day.

I was in a relationship (on and off) with someone I loved very much. We tried again and again to make it work, but it became really toxic and painful. I ended up having to get a protection order against him recently, which completely shattered me. I still love him. I still see the beauty and potential in him, and it’s painful to know how much pain he’s carrying and how much he resists getting help for it.

He has bipolar disorder, and has always been strongly anti-medication or therapy. Meanwhile, I’ve been trying to get help for my own mental health, especially ADHD. I started taking Adderall because I’ve lived so long in chaos, and I just wanted to be more functional: more organized, more stable, a better partner, a better parent figure. But to him, Adderall was “Nazi meth.” He genuinely believed it was destroying me and our relationship. That I was selfish for taking it.

And I’ll be honest… I started to believe him. I’ve asked myself again and again if maybe I ruined everything by trying to help myself. Maybe I was changing. Maybe I was harder to be around. Maybe I lost the plot.

But deep down, I think I was just trying to find balance. We were raising his son together, my stepson, who is non-verbal and autistic. I love him so much, and it was incredibly challenging. I often suggested things like summer programs or additional help to ease the load, but I was always shot down. There was so much resistance to any outside support, and I ended up feeling like I was drowning while also being blamed for not being enough. We also have a two year old son together and are married as well.

I don’t know… I’m just lost right now. I want to believe I’m not a bad person for trying to get help. I want to believe I didn’t destroy everything by wanting to be better. But it’s hard when the person you love paints your healing as betrayal.Thank you for letting me share this. If anyone has been through something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing from you.",3,0,1753206023.0,mentalhealth,Daddy_Demarco,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6kog9/trying_to_take_care_of_myself_while_loving/,2025-07-25T09:58:19.596396
1m6tuj0,"37 Years of Struggle ... Abuse, Chronic Illness, Long Covid, Breakup, and Now I'm lost. How do i build a future from here?","Throwaway account because I’m not comfortable posting this on my main. I just need to get this out there because I’m completely lost and I don’t know what else to do.

I’m 37. It feels like my entire life has been one long struggle.

* Grew up in an abusive home.
* Chronic anxiety and panic attacks kept me stuck at home from 15 to 22.
* Developed essential tremors when I was 16 ... similar to Parkinson’s, but less understood.
* I was depressed, stuck living with my parents, couldn’t find my footing in life.
* Spent my 20s trying to get better, trying to come to terms with the tremors. Some progress, but life was still small and limited. Still living with my dad.
* At 33, I became homeless. I bounced around 12 hostels across the country trying to find stability.
* Eventually got back in touch with an old girlfriend. Moved north, got a council job, we moved in together. Life finally felt like it was starting to go somewhere.

Then I caught Covid. I didn’t think much of it at first, but I developed Long Covid ... or PACS as they call it. And my entire life stopped.

In just a few weeks, I went from climbing mountains on weekends to being bedbound, barely able to breathe, talk, or walk. Damaged lungs, brain fog, chronic fatigue, inflamed blood vessels, neurological issues ... at one point I was counting 80+ symptoms.

Doctors said, ***“ It’s Long Covid, but we have no treatments, just theories. Go home and hope for the best.”***

So that’s what I did. I went home. But I didn’t want to roll over and die, so I spent hours and hours reading medical studies, trying to understand what was happening to me, figuring out any way to heal.

It’s been 3.5 years and I’m about 85% recovered. I’m hoping for remission next year.

But last week, my partner left. She told me she couldn’t do it anymore ... she’d lost herself in our situation and needed more from life. I wasn’t shocked. The last few years have been brutally hard on both of us. We couldn’t really socialise, travel, or live normally. Even a cold could’ve set me back months. I tried to encourage her to live her life, take trips, keep growing. But I could see the strain on her.

Now she’s gone and I’m alone. I don’t blame her, but it still hurts like hell.

I have my apartment for now, benefits should cover rent and food, but I’ve got no career, no pension, barely any real life experience. I’ve only ever worked two jobs ... retail and local council.

I’m scared about the future. What happens if I get Covid again and it floors me for another 3 years? What does my life look like when I’m old? Will I just rot away poor, alone and unwanted?

Right now I’ve got a basic routine ... a bit of meditation, some light yoga, lifting a few weights to keep my body moving. I’ve been trying to get more into Buddhism. But the rest of the day I’m stuck in my head, worried about the future .. will i even have a pension ?

I just… I don’t know what to do ... Am I too late? Is there a way forward? I’m trying to stay hopeful but it’s hard when it feels like life passed me by.

If anyones been through anything like this or has any advice ... I would really appreciate it.",1,0,1753227484.0,mentalhealth,Turbulent_Eagle1660,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6tuj0/37_years_of_struggle_abuse_chronic_illness_long/,2025-07-25T09:58:19.596396
1m6tjzv,Broke 4 years clean of SH,"I like to think I am more rational, more in control, more aware and educated than I ever was on my conditions. But it turns out I’m not, I relapsed, and I’m ashamed, disappointed, and mad at myself when my partner of 8 years was right there, and I locked him out. I didnt just hurt myself, I hurt him, and I think that hurts me more. 

I’m 26, have multiple physical disabilities and I have autism, adhd, severe anxiety and severe depression and emotional unstable personallity disorder. I am on a lot of meds, most days I feel nothing.

The trigger: something my partner said made me feel like i was a kid again (i was abused as a kid) (my partner has never hurt or raised his voice or spoken bad to me, it was the way i interpreted not a him issue we were literally just having a regular conversation) just something in me in that moment took me back to feeling like that hurt child when i was being spoken to. It thrown me off, all my logic went out the window, all my control went.

I told him how I felt, it wasnt enough to take me out of it, I used an old self harm coping mechanism of grabbing my wrist skin and basically using it as an elastic band, nope, my partner went to sort the bins outside, and thats when I bolted. To the bathroom, locked, one last resort, wrists under the cold tap, nothing, no relief, grabbed the tweezers, took some stray leg hairs out, it wasnt enough. Then the blade. 

The second I heard his voice, I knew I’d fucked up and it was too late. The worst part? I felt no relief, nothing, no pain, not even when he cleaned me up with antiseptic, no stinging, nothing, couldnt even cry. All I could do was look at him and say I was sorry. And its eating me up inside how much I fucked up and it didnt even help. The moment of me feeling like that just eventually passed after he distracted me. 

I dont see therapist cause I just find it more harmful than helpful (if you have been in UK NHS systems you’ll prob understand why) I just kinda needed to get it off my chest",1,1,1753226728.0,mentalhealth,Fozlou,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6tjzv/broke_4_years_clean_of_sh/,2025-07-25T09:58:19.596396
1m6tgcu,I was bullied really badly. Will l ever be able to make friends where I'm from?,"I dropped out of school because I was so badly bullied it affected my mental health. I haven't been to school for two years,but I've been studying at home because I don't want my mental health to win. I'm starting a new course in September which is amazing. I feel deep down as crazy as it might sound, that there is no way people wont judge me, and know about how everyone hated me in secondary school, how i went crazy.
    I mean when I was in school I would sit in class and pretend i didn't know there were boys recording me talking about my body and photoshopping me to look disgusting. They past the pictures around and everyone started looking at me like I was dirty, like i was naked when I was fully clothed. ""Desperate"" they called me ""desperate for a man"" even the teachers said it....mind you I never spoke to the boys only awkwardly laugh when they made disgusting comments about my body in front of everyone,then I would go cry about it in the bathroom. 
   I feel like everyone where I'm from hates me because random people who I didn't know knew me would be really rude to me. I remember one time a boy from an older year held the door open for me because it was heavy and then he turned to his friend and said ""oh no you shouldn't have done that,she's a bitch"" it made me feel like I wasn't human,like i wasn't good enough to be nice to. 
   I walked into a random caffe by my house once and a random girl I don't even know was behind the till and refused to serve me. ""That girl is a massive freak"" she said to the other lady working there.

1m6hh8u,I (M26) called my ex gf(F24) 60+ times. Feel like Idk who I am,"I was with a girl, let’s call her P, for 8 months. She wasn’t just my girlfriend—she was someone I pictured a life with. But our relationship had a lot of unspoken weight, and we both carried more into it than we knew how to handle.

At the start, things were passionate but intense. She was emotional, deeply feeling, and I was more shut down. I’d go from present to completely withdrawn, especially at night. She used to say I’d “switch up” on her when I couldn’t hold space for her emotions. She wasn’t wrong.

She sometimes felt like I made her a second option, like she was a runner-up to the girl I dated casually before her. I was over that girl, but I don’t think I was over the wounds that relationship opened in me. I never processed them, and they bled into what I had with P.

She needed reassurance and presence. I didn’t know how to give that without feeling like I was failing. I couldn’t explain my shutdowns, so she felt unwanted—like I was one foot out the door. That wasn’t how I felt, but I know it’s what I made her feel.

After we broke up, I told myself I’d respect her space. I lasted a few days. Then last Saturday night, I spiraled. I got drunk, called her over 70 times, and blacked out. Since then, I’ve been drowning in shame, wondering if I’ve destroyed any chance of peace or understanding between us.

I’ve started therapy, but my first appointment is three weeks away. I’m scared I won’t make it that long without getting worse. This spiral doesn’t feel like something I can just ride out. It’s like I’m clinging to whatever pieces of myself I haven’t already burned through.

I’ve realized this isn’t just about her. It’s old stuff I’ve never dealt with—things from my childhood I buried. This breakup cracked it all open.

I still see her as the most beautiful person I’ve ever known, not just in how she looked but how she felt to be around. I miss what we were before it got complicated. Before the fights, before I started spiraling and forgetting how to show up.

I feel broken, sometimes beyond repair. But the truth is, when I was with her, she made me feel like I wasn’t. Like maybe I could be whole. Now that she’s gone, I’m facing everything I’ve avoided for years.

I haven’t cried in over a decade. But now? I’ve cried almost every day since we ended. It scares me, because I’ve lost control of something I thought I’d buried.

I love this girl. I really do. Now I even dream about her—vividly. I’ve dreamed of calling her and another man picking up and telling me to stop. I’ve dreamed of running into him at a bar, and it felt so real I woke up shaking. My brain won’t give me peace, even when I sleep.

Ultimately, I just miss my best friend. I woke up today feeling okay for a moment, and then it hit me all over again. She’s gone. I cried for 15 minutes straight.

Right now, I don’t think I deserve to be in a relationship with anyone—not until I fix this. Not until I understand myself enough to not let my past keep dictating my future.

I know I’m not the first person to spiral after a breakup, but this feels deeper. The urge to reach out, to fix something, to be seen—it’s unbearable. And the worst part is, I know I caused some of this pain.

Not looking for pity or to shift blame. I just want to hear from people who’ve been through this level of self-destruction and made it out the other side. How did you rebuild after losing someone—and yourself—in the process?

1m68ynv,I’m 31 weeks pregnant and emotionally exhausted… I just needed to let this out somewhere,"I’m 31 weeks pregnant, and this phase something I thought would feel magical has turned into one of the loneliest, most emotionally draining experiences of my life.

My husband works a demanding job that keeps him away for long periods. It’s not his fault, and I knew about it before we married.

My MIL is a nice person overall, and I do believe she means well, but she gets very rigid and intense when it comes to superstitions and rituals. My BIL is getting married next year, and she was initially insistent on having the wedding in a high-altitude temple in freezing weather in February. My baby will only be five months old by then, and I was so anxious about managing such a trip. In Indian families, missing a wedding is not even considered an option—and of course, I couldn’t leave the baby behind with my parents either. I tried to explain all of this so many times, gently, but she wouldn’t hear it.

Thankfully, something shifted and she finally agreed to drop the mountain temple plan. That felt like a huge relief.

Then came the date selection. There were two “auspicious” dates: 15th and 17th February. My husband and I got married on the 17th. That date is special to me. It carries emotional weight. I was hoping she’d pick the 15th and let us keep that one day as our own.

But no—she chose the 17th. Again.

I even made a lighthearted joke, saying, “Now we don’t get to party twice,” and nudged her about choosing the 15th. But she just smiled and said she likes the 17th. That was the end of the conversation.

It might sound childish, but it really hurt. I just wanted one day that stayed ours. And now, our anniversary will be shared with a big family wedding every year—and not even ours.

When I told my husband how I felt, he was totally unbothered. He actually said he was happy and thought it was a cool coincidence. He didn’t understand why I was even upset.

And that’s been the story of our marriage so far. We’ve been married for two years but have only lived together for about four months in total. Every time he comes home, I ask if we can travel, go out—just spend some time together. But he always wants to stay home with his parents, and insists I be there too. I do it, every time, without complaint. But I’ve always longed for some time that’s just ours.

Even the pregnancy wasn’t fully my decision. He wanted a child soon because his parents are getting older. I said I wanted more time with him first, to just be a couple—but I gave in. I don’t regret the pregnancy, not for a second. I already love this baby with all my heart. But I wish someone had considered me in all this.

He’s currently away again for a demanding course, and we barely speak. He’s always tired, always distracted. Meanwhile, I’m here, growing a whole human, trying to stay strong, and feeling like I’m slowly fading.

I’ve tried bringing this up with him, telling him how I feel. But it always ends in a fight. He accuses me of not wanting him to spend time with his family, when that’s not true at all. I just want to feel seen. Heard. Prioritized, even just a little.

Maybe it’s the hormones. Maybe I’m overly emotional. But I feel like I’m disappearing. Like I’ve poured myself into this marriage and motherhood journey, and I don’t know who’s there for me anymore.

1m6sdkc,Why can’t I focus on the present and future,"I’m curious how others deal with negative headspace and how to find motivation. I feel weak just typing this out. Possibly due to the stigmas to bottle it up and deal with it. Maybe the “just be a man” part. 

Over the years making purchases or doing something only to lose interest has made me see I’ve chased a dose of serotonin and/or dopamine. Even games and shows Ive enjoyed for years I rarely play and watch now. I often ask myself what makes me happy as I dont understand what or why. I’ll talk myself out of doing something i was previously excited about or just lay in bed due to restless sleep from reminiscing or reliving past. Especially past relationship. I’ve only been in 1 long term relationship although have been in several throughout my life. It ended horribly and not on mutual terms along with leaving many questions unanswered. Currently I’m 32. I would have figured I’d be married with a family by now. Due to this I find it hard to continue on most days. 

Additionally, the continuous comparison of others is the thief of joy, yet I still do. I know I’ve been blessed many times however still compare whether it’s money, family, relationship or place in life. I try to associate it with shift work, sleep patterns, or anything else however, looking back seems to have been the same then too.

1m6s1m5,Something wrong,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I don’t know what I feel, I don’t know how to live my life happily, I don’t know anything, really.

For all my life I knew that I felt and thought differently to my peers, especially in my childhood. I’d always wonder why I had such a hard time making friends, or why my friends never seemed to give out as much care, love and loyalty as I would on a daily basis. Or why I’d be looked at so differently by adults or other people compared to another, even if I had copied everything they did.

Living has always felt like a challenge, a hard task that seems to never end, a chore. It exhausts me, and I know that it shouldn’t (to this extent, and so easily at that). Conversations shouldn’t be so difficult, shouldn’t feel like I’m acting out a one woman show for five minutes, and still running out of things to say so quickly. Walking shouldn’t feel so physically exerting, like I’m dragging myself along instead of flowing through like I see others do so simply. Waking up shouldn’t be so disappointing, blinking shouldn’t feel so heavy, breathing shouldn’t be so painful, blah blah blah.

I’ve never been able to see the happy side of living, like my friends that I see laughing like it’s just a breeze tickling their ribs. I’ve always been depressed, always hated existing. Always hoped I could hide away forever.

Relationships don’t come easy for me, can barely look someone in the eye let alone form a bond with them. It’s so painful, getting to know someone while having to act like your happy doing so. It gives me a headache honestly. And when I do form the bond I so desperately wanted, I always end up going too far, somehow, and end up on the other end, hating them. I can’t help it, my mind picks out their flaws and presents them to me on a platter. And I hate myself for it, I really do. No matter how much I love them it’s like my mind is against me.

I have tried forcing myself to go out, fix a mask on and try.  But I just get pulled back down, by I don’t know what, and end up rotting in bed for the foreseeable until I’m okay enough to get in the shower again.

My life is full of could have been’s, pretending, and utter exhaustion. No matter what I do I am exhausted. And I can’t seem to bring myself to get help, and do what I am meant to. Because that would mean even more effort and I am afraid that it would kill me.

1m6rvws,Hyperactive gag reflex,"I really don't know where to post this, but I really need help

  
So I've had this thing pretty much my entire life (28M). Only recently my ex found out what it was. I have a hyperactive gag reflex.

  
When I was a kid I already had issues with some smells, in particular the smell of the fridge, it would make me gag. As I grew up, I somehow found out that Tic Tacs (from now on I will just say TT) would help. So I always had a few of them in my pocket (because carrying the whole Tic Tac box made noise, and then people would ask me to have one). Water or some sort of liquid also helps, I take a sip and keep it in my mouth, and usually it makes it go away, but not all the time. 

Since then I have been struggling with it a lot. Basically it's like when you go to the dentist and they put stuff at the back of your mouth and it makes you gag. Except that for me, this happens every day. It seems to be caused by stress and anxiety, and I only had one doctor who took it seriously and told me my brain was in a constant fight or flight mode, thus explaining all of that.

Also what happens a lot in these moments is that I need to yawn. And it's hard to describe, but when I yawn, I have to stop everything I'm doing, and I have to focus on yawning until the end. If something even touches my throat (in these moments it's incredibly sensitive) or if I think too much or I can't finish my yawn, I start gagging. And when it happens, I will be dry heaving non stop. Nothing comes out, I just can't stop myself. When it happens, I drink water and breathe deeply, but it takes me a few minutes to calm down, and I cannot speak or open my mouth.

For some years I was doing okay, maybe taking one TT every week or so. Then when I was 14, at the end of middle school, I started being very anxious. I already had bad anxiety before but this time it became really intense. I went from one TT every week to like 20 or more a day.

I have that problem pretty much all of the time. When I'm doing okay, it's usually not present, but sometimes it shows up. But because of my general anxiety, it comes up very quickly. When I take a TT, I keep it in my mouth until it fully desolves, and that's been a problem, because my teeth pay the price and I have had many cavities. Lately I have partially switched to little sugar substitute things (the kind you put in coffee), and they help, but I still take TT.

I've been living my life like that for years now. When I go to bed I have a few TTs or sugar substitutes, because when I fall asleep or when I wake up in the middle of the night, I often have the gag problem, and I have to calm it down.

  
I just want to know if anybody out there has a similar thing, if anyone has any kind of advice, if anyone has heard of something like this, just anything, because this has been ruining my life for over 20 years",1,0,1753222485.0,mentalhealth,Steppenwlf,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6rvws/hyperactive_gag_reflex/,2025-07-25T09:58:19.596396
1m6rjtm,[Need Help] Unexplainable Internal Emotional Storm - Has Anyone Felt This?,"I’ve been struggling with something that no doctor has been able to clearly explain. I’m hoping that maybe someone here has experienced something similar.

Out of nowhere, I get hit by what I can only describe as an intense internal emotional storm. It’s not sadness, not fear, not anxiety in the classic sense. It’s just this overwhelming, unbearable inner discomfort that takes over completely.

I can’t sit still. I can’t rest. I don’t want to talk to anyone, but I also don’t want to be alone. I feel trapped in my body and mind. Nothing feels right — everything feels wrong — but there’s no specific thought or fear behind it. It’s not physical either: no racing heart, no chest pain, no hyperventilation. Just this horrible internal state that makes existing feel almost unbearable.

The feeling usually lasts for hours, sometimes days. It’s worst at the beginning, then it lingers in a less intense way. People around me don’t notice anything — I seem calm on the outside — but internally it’s like a storm I can’t escape.

Benzos don’t help. SSRIs (specifically Prozac) seemed to make it worse at first, though I’m sticking with it for now. I’ve always been a high-functioning person, and I’ve dealt with stress, burnout, even some somatic anxiety in the past… but this is something completely different.

I’m now afraid of traveling, drinking, or even making plans — because I live in fear of feeling that again.

If anyone has experienced something similar — or knows what this could be — please reach out. I’m just trying to understand what this is and how to deal with it.

1m6leej,It was a chapter I never closed. I just stopped reading.,"Sometimes I wish I could go back and undo things.  
My 20s weren’t just about growing up (Still in 20s) – they were about surviving. I went through things I never thought I would. Not some epic downfall, but small, sharp, cutting moments that built up over time and wore me down.

In those years, everything I tried seemed to fail. Internships, college stuff, friendships – nothing felt stable.  
But somewhere in all that mess, I fell in love. Not just a crush or passing phase, but something deep, something that felt like home in a world that didn’t make sense.

She was the calm in my storm. The one who saw me at my worst and still stayed. We’d talk about the future, about healing, about making something better out of the mess we were handed.  
But life didn’t let it last. Time, mistakes, and life pulled us apart. And I don’t know if she ever really knew how much she meant to me.

That love – my last love – it changed me. It opened parts of me I didn’t know were there. And when it was gone, it didn’t just break my heart, it shattered something deeper.  
Some days I still feel like I'm living in that shadow.

There was a time I didn’t think I’d make it through. I don’t say that lightly – I was seriously slipping into a place where I thought of ending it all. I kept those thoughts buried, hidden even from myself.  
Then I thought about my brother’s baby, expected in a few days. I wondered, why should I disrupt their happiness by ending my life? I felt helpless, stuck in the center of it all.

But the one constant in all of this was my father.  
Quiet support, unspoken understanding. He didn’t always have the right words, but his presence held me together more than he’ll ever know.  
Even when I felt like the world had forgotten me, he hadn’t.

It’s strange – I never had some big breakdown, no dramatic goodbye. I just stopped. I stopped feeling like myself.  
And that’s the hardest part.  
It wasn’t one moment. It was a slow fading. Like turning the pages of a book and realizing you don’t recognize the story anymore.

This chapter of my life? I never really closed it.  
I just stopped reading.

1m6r27p,Is it worth calling my therapist ?,"My mental health is... not strong to say the least. I am quite unstable in many ways, and I think my therapist realized this because she told me that even tho she will be in vacations in the summer, she is available if I want to send her an emergency e-mail or call.

I have been in therapy since january, and I was doing so well that I almost thought that all of this was unecessary. I thought I could go all summer without therapy.

However, the last weeks/months, I :

- felt extremely suicidal (but then it got better somehow)
- felt very powerful to the point were I did things like publicly announce that I would immediately change my personality to become ""the better version of myself"" (I did not)
- ate and slept only sparingly
- started to feel like everybody hated me (it's a recurring thought but this time it's very strong)
- felt stressed 90% of the time

I must confess that my mental health has rarely been so... erratic. But I still don't feel legitimate to bother my therapist because she deserves vacations and I don't want to be a bother to anyone. I mean, I don't have any diagnoses, so I don't feel legitimate to say ""I urgently need help"". And help for what ? I can't even name what's wrong, I just feel wrong.

Anyway is it worth it ? Or are these symptoms not worth any urgency ?",1,0,1753220482.0,mentalhealth,Houmouss,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6r27p/is_it_worth_calling_my_therapist/,2025-07-25T09:58:19.596396
1m6r1at,Friend acts very tough but comes off as rude and insecure. Can I help him change for the better?,"For starters he recently came back from military basic training. I think that took a lot out of him because he was put out of his comfort zone. And never really faced any discipline like that before. He couldn’t take it and was sent home after possibly having an anxiety attack. Fair enough it’s definitely not meant for everyone. 

He told me about all this stuff he’d like to do once he got home to better his life. He’s making a bit of progress on these things and I’m really happy for him but he tends to spend time blaming other people and things out of his control for his issues rather than being productive. 

On top of that he doesn’t have much irl friends. I’m not sure he’s ever really been in a relationship with anyone. But he at times seems pretty desperate for one. The issue is he’s got a bit of an attitude problem. I think he’s tries to put on a front to impress people but it really just comes off as rude and awkward. For example every time we’re out together he insists on walking in front in a very “manly” way which just looks ridiculous. I know he doesn’t walk that way naturally. 

He talks about his skills in things that he definitely doesn’t have skills in. He complains a lot when he realizes he’s not properly set himself up for things. The written drivers test for example he complains about how he failed because of the trick questions and wants to take a test where there are none. He doesn’t understand that the trick questions are there to make sure you know what you’re doing on the road. They aren’t there to force people to fail who know the rules of the road.

One time he scratched me by accident and when he apologized I said it’s okay I’m tough I’ll live. And he immediately responded with, “no, it’s just because your skin is dry that it didn’t hurt that much.” In an offended sounding way.

He’d complain on how the military was setting him up to fail because of the marching, the food, the repetition, the clothing, the yelling, you name it. Which is understandable the military isn’t supposed to be easy. But this training is how they set people up to be good fits and how people find out if it is or isn’t for them. And it’s okay if it’s not which is what I told him but also that it’s good to learn some endurance and perseverance rather than give up right away and be sent home feeling bad about yourself.

All in all I think his self esteem is at a bad place and it’s been that way for a while. When his behaviour makes things worse. I really want to help him change. I want to see him get more friends and hopefully even a girlfriend. Any ideas on how to support him and guide him in that direction is appreciated.

1m6kaaj,College Is Rotting My Brain & I Can’t Stop Obsessing Over It Even Though I Know It Doesn’t Matter.,"College Is Rotting My Brain & I Can’t Stop Obsessing Over It Even Though I Know It Doesn’t Matter

I’m 19, and I feel like college is actively making me dumber.
I’m not saying this out of laziness or drama — I know I’m already smart. I’ve always been curious, thoughtful, and sharp-minded. But this college system? It’s draining me. I feel like it’s casting brain rot over me daily.

The worst part is: I KNOW this college doesn’t define me. I KNOW these classes, these pointless assignments, these boring professors — none of it aligns with my real goals. I’ve rationalized it a hundred times. I’ve told myself it doesn’t matter long-term.
But somehow, I can’t stop obsessing over it.

I overthink classes, tasks, teachers.

I keep getting mentally dragged into things I don’t even care about.

Even in my dreams, college invades my head.


It’s like my brain doesn’t respect my priorities anymore. I can’t just “shrug it off.” I feel things deeply. I absorb the negativity, the dumb routines, the boredom.
I’m exhausted.
My brain fog is the worst it’s ever been.
I feel like I’m mentally trapped in something that doesn’t deserve this much power over me.

All I want is to protect my peace, stop caring about this nonsense, and move on with my life. But every day it creeps back into my thoughts and messes with my headspace.

Does anyone else relate?
How do you emotionally detach from a system you know is irrelevant but can’t fully escape yet?
How do you stop thinking about something you logically know isn’t worth your energy?

1m6q4qz,Am I being too harsh ?,"Please read this whole thing before you judge me. Me ""F20"" and my boyfriend ""M20""met around 2 years ago for the first time as my mum knows his dad so I have been especially close to his parents since we got together (5 months ago) as I knew them before. Since the start of our relationship it has always seemed one sided, for example he would go hours and hours without messaging me and would then message me as if nothing happened or be really off with me but then leave it until im feeling rubbish to tell me he is sorry for being a bad boyfriend and he needs to be better etc. Something that really started to bother me was we would arrange to meet and he would then ignore me the whole day i was supposed to be seeing him then would turn up as if nothing happened. I spoke to him about this and he said the usual apology and then just went straight back to doing it. A few days ago he started acting really strange and i tried so hard to get him to speak to me because i could tell something was going on but he wouldnt tell me. We then went to a wedding and he eventually told me that his dad had tried to commit and was now in a psychiatric hospital. I feel terrible and I love him and want to support him as much as I possibly can however he is just acting like we arent together, he will go an entire day without messaging me then will message all happy telling me how much he loves me with no explanation as to why he hasnt been answering me. I feel like I am making this situation about me and that is that last thing I want to do if i am being horrible then I want to know but i can just feel this having a huge impact on me and its making me realize more and more how one sided our relationship has always been.

1m6gdyv,i can’t fix my sleep schedule and i feel like i’m dying or losing my sanity,"i always had issues with sleep. it wasn’t like i never got enough of it - i always tried to have at least 6h and usually have like 9h of it. but i can’t SET any sleep schedule for myself. it can be normal for couple of days, then it’s broken again. and it’s a loop. that implies i surely tried to not to sleep for a whole night and day and it could help at some point but only for a couple days. also whenever i try to fix my sleep schedule in this way i just kinda stop feeling tired even though i was sleep deprived for a lot of hours.

at the same time, when i realize how many hours i’m not sleeping and when i start to feel tired again, i get a feeling like i’m dying: i have a huge brainfog, i struggle to talk, i don’t get enough air, i’m dizzy and my blood pressure is usually low too. it also leads me to panic attacks, where i refuse to sleep for some extra hours because i get afraid imma die fr.

it’s been 6 months already i struggle with all of that. and i don’t know what to do. my mental health went so bad too. i’m hopeless, wanting to cry whenever i wake up after such sleep, i feel like i’m slowly losing my cognitive functions and becoming a vegetable. it's like i have random unrealistic thoughts that i believe for some reason (but then doubting them) or like i don't know if some word i say really exists or i just made it up. i also struggle to type, to talk, to walk. 

also for a context i’m F21, recently went to a lot of doctors to check my hormones, heart, blood and ever was fine. my psychiatrist says i may have an anxiety and depression but i doubt meds would help with it. also i spend a lot of time by my pc playing games, never really going outside. ik it's a huge problem but i had zero motivation to change my lifestyle and now im afraid it lead me to this mental state which is uncurable.",3,8,1753196413.0,mentalhealth,apmxayc,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6gdyv/i_cant_fix_my_sleep_schedule_and_i_feel_like_im/,2025-07-25T09:58:20.724300

I've recently developed hypocondria (or rather health anxiety) due to recurring anxiety plus an injury i've had recently. I constantly worry and panic that i'm gonna die or have a debilitating illness (i.e cancer), and my anxiety makes me believe that i actually do have something.

As stupid as it sounds, i fear that i'll die tomorrow, i fear that, since my sister died that day i'll also do that, i fear that this is the end of the line and i can't convince myself otherwise, i'm scared to sleep in fear that i won't wake up, and i'm not sure how i'll deal with tomorrow.

After that, I didn't talk to any girls throughout high school again, not even platonically, while everyone around me eventually got into relationships easily. Even now in my second year of university.

I'm still bitter about it. It's not about rejection. I don't care about that. I can take rejection pretty well, and I have been rejected by girls before Bella. It was about the nature of the rejection itself, and how she went as far as to creating a group chat, adding everyone in it and seeking for help to reject me. Was I that bad? That ugly? One of those guys where the girls wished wouldn't talk to them or would get disgusted? Would I get rejected like that again if I liked another girl?

I don't know how to move on. I did move on, eventually, after 6 months, but some days the thought of that would re-enter my memory and it would sting badly. Affecting my self-esteem and increasing my insecurity. I never talked to a girl again in fear of being rejected like that again. I know it's been 4 years. I know it's just a ""rejection"", it shouldn't affect me that badly and everyone goes through that at some point in their lives. I mean I went through rejections before the brutal rejection from Bella. But this is stinging deep and affecting me significantly.

1m6o77k,Not depressed but going through something i cant explain and need help,"Hey. Throwaway as I want to be anon.

I've had some pretty bad issues with mental health. I spent my mid 20s depressed as fuck, agoraphobia, the whole works. I'm now late 30s and i know im not depressed. I could not be happier, i own a home, i work a good job, have a kid and a partner. I dont want for anything so i feel like a fraud even being upset.

I feel very mortal all of a sudden. Last few months. My mum and dad are getting on, my parents dog is on its last legs. My sons already blast through a year of primary school. Everything is moving so fast and i dont want it to. I wish it was 20 years ago, i dunno where the last 10 went. I dont feel nearly 40 but im aware i am. I fear that in a few years ill start to lose irreplaceable things. My dad, my mum, family pet, the home i grew up in will be mine but empty. Ive already lost my grandparents and some family. Even lost a friend young.

I cant get out of a cycle of nostalgia, everything old feels comforting and makes me happy. I find it difficult to enjoy the ""modern"" world. Everythings moved on without me without me even realising. Im the Simpsons meme of i used to be with it, then they changed what it was.

Id say its a mid life crisis but honestly, i have no urge to do anything mid lifey.

The only thing that keeps me sane is my son. I find purpose in him. But looking at me and my friends, this wasnt how life was meant to be. Even celebrities that were ubiquitous in our lives look old and tired, are dead, long dead or no longer around. I looked up someone the other day to find out he died in 2013, it took me 12 years to realise they werent around.

1m6nwtc,32 and lost,"My whole life, I felt my purpose on this Earth was to help people. In February 2018, I entered the caregiving field. I stuck with one company for 5 years. Got extremely close to staff, office, managers, and my clients. I was naive, oblivious, and thought everything was good. These people even came to my wedding. Not even a year later, all hell broke loose.
My husband was one of the home managers for 5 years. He was a yes man and did anything and everything that was asked of him. It was destroying his mental health and I finally convinced someone day to step down. That's when everything went down. They sent spies to his home, altered paperwork, they even put the blame on me when I reported a staff for stealing groceries. That's when I finally learned that people will use you up until you stop giving. 
Unfortunately, I'm still in caregiving at another company and it's just more drama. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I'm so sick of all the drama. I'm a hard worker, I do everything. What I do know, is that I'm so sick of working under my worth. I'm so sick of doing everyone's job, being involved in drama,  always getting the shit end no matter how hard I try to do what's right.

1m6c7nk,I moved across the world for a fresh start. But I still feel deeply unattractive and quietly alone.,"I wrote a post here recently about feeling deeply unattractive and alone.

This is the continuation. Not for pity. Not even for healing. Just… to say it plainly.

Here’s what I find unattractive about myself:

I overthink everything. I study every photo, every interaction, every message. I dissect myself like I’m looking for proof that I’m worth something — and I always find the opposite.

My face feels… confusing. Sometimes I feel decent. Other times, I look at myself and feel like I’m stuck between ""not ugly"" and ""not attractive either."" Forgettable. That’s the word.

My beard doesn’t suit me. My mustache feels try-hard. My skin breaks out. I don’t know what look to stick with, and no matter what I try, I always feel like I fall short of “effortlessly attractive.”

My body isn't what I want it to be. I’m not obese. But I see fat where I don’t want to. I scroll past shirtless guys on Instagram and feel like I don’t belong in the same species.

My voice sounds too soft. Or too stiff. I don't know. When I hear it in recordings, I flinch. It doesn’t match the intensity I feel inside.

I talk too much sometimes. Or too little. I try to be interesting. Or funny. Or thoughtful. But I always feel like I’m trying. And nothing is more unattractive than someone trying too hard.

I care too much what people think. I check who saw my stories. I re-edit captions. I wonder if people who left me on seen just didn’t care enough. And I hate that I give that so much power.

I’ve ruined relationships — family ones, especially. I fought to live the life I believed in, and I don’t regret it. But I broke things in the process. I left India, left Delhi University, and chose a different path — but I carry the guilt of how much damage I left behind.

Romantically, I’ve had nothing. No relationships. No experiences. Sometimes I tell myself I was just focused on other things. But the truth is… no one ever chose me. And I don’t know if anyone ever will.

I think I can be arrogant. And insecure. A weird mix. I dream huge. I want to change the world. I want to build something massive. But I also collapse inward over small things. I need validation more than I should. I say things I don’t mean just to sound like I’ve figured it out.

I don’t know if I’m loveable. Or likeable. Or desirable. I get praised sometimes. People tell me I’m sharp. Or driven. Or different. But when it’s dark, and I’m alone with myself, I feel like none of that matters. I feel like a ghost wearing ambition as perfume.

I feel like I’m too much, and not enough. At the same time.

This post isn’t about self-hate. I don’t want to destroy myself. I just want to say what’s been crawling under my skin for years.

Because maybe — somewhere out there — someone else feels this way too. And maybe saying it, honestly, without pretending to be okay, is better than staying silent.

1m6n3ns,My anxiety is making me sleepless. Need suggestions on what to do to help me.,"Even so many things passes through my mind I go through a day easily. But in night, I become really anxious and couldn't sleep even when I'm very tired. It feels like I'm afraid to go sleep, I just don't want to sleep, want to stay awake however possible and sometimes I do. When sun comes up and I started to hear hustle and bustle around me. Only then I feels like it is safe enough to sleep.

Initially, I thought this is happening because of the life issues I'm going through but I think it's my anxiety that's making my feeling/reaction towards those issues worse. Even watching a sad movie overhwelms me. All those sad parts of it keep coming to my head, keep me awake and make me to watch something funny/relaxing to push all those negativity out. It's making me kind a addicted to porn. I go through porn websites daily just to look what's new. Don't even watch most of the times. Still, go through websites like a scheduled work.

I don't know what to do now. Most things are not helpful or difficult to keep up with. Is this time for me to take professional help or is there still something that I can try to help myself through this.

1m6my21,Younger sister is struggling with self harm- need advice,"Hi Reddit,

I am a 27 year old seeking advice on how to better help my younger sister, 12 years old, who confided in me last night that she has been hurting herself. Our family has a history of depression on both sides, and I had always worried about any of my four little sisters inheriting these mental problems. I myself struggle with major depression, OCPD, ADHD, and CPTSD. I had hoped that if this day ever came, I would know exactly what to do and how to best help any of my girls- but instead, I find myself almost lost and scared to make a mistake.

  
The first step I took was giving her a space last night to just say whatever and tell me what's been bothering her. From what I gathered, my sister struggles with low self-esteem and a general feeling of not understanding who she is- and whatever she does understand she doesn't like. I understand her in this level because I am the same way. I told her I would find a safety plan template for me to help her fill out this evening, and that we would go over her potential triggers and what she can do in those moments to come back down to Earth. 

  
The problem is, is that she told me she tried to take her life a couple nights ago. She has a cut on her neck from where she tried to use the string from the blinds. I've cried so much since last night. The worst part is she made me promise not to tell our mom, and this is where I am struggling the most. My parents generally don't understand mental health issues, and tend to prefer to pretend it's not that big of a deal and will go away on it's own. My mom always had her issues with me taking psychiatric medications to help with my own chemical imbalance, and I genuinely believe that my mom doesn't trust or believe in the benefits of therapy. I think she would rather that us talking to her would be enough to save any of us. 

  
My mom knows my sister is hurting herself, but my mom is hoping that I will be enough to get my sister to stop. I think my mom is hoping I can use whatever I learned from DBT and therapy to help my sister, and that I can get her to stop myself. I tried to talk to my mom about me helping her find affordable counseling for my sister, but she keeps saying my dad makes to much for them to qualify- but not enough for insurance or to be able to afford therapy. It's so much pressure on all sides, but I NEED to help my baby sister. My three youngest sisters, which the one I am discussing today is a part of, were my first babies I ever cared for. I held her and changed her diapers growing up, I gave her bottles and sang her to sleep. I cannot lose her, no matter what. My sister's are the reason why I am still here, and knowing one of them is going through this type of pain that I have felt so much in life is killing me. I feel like I have failed as the oldest sister. 

  
Please people of reddit, help me. Give me ideas on what type of coping mechanisms I can teach her, what to say to her. I live in central Texas, if you have ideas on resources I could use to help her. We are Mexican Americans, my grandparents are the ones who immigrated here, so we are citizens by birth. 

  
Also, do I break my sister's trust and just tell my mom about her trying to end herself? I am genuinely scared that my mom won't take it that seriously, or think my sister is being dramatic. I don't want to lose her trust in her mental health journey when I just received it.",1,3,1753211008.0,mentalhealth,Fate_and_Chaos,True,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6my21/younger_sister_is_struggling_with_self_harm_need/,2025-07-25T09:58:20.724300
1m6mxi6,How Creative Wellness and Student Voice Can Transform Our Communities,"Hi everyone,

I recently published an Op-Ed that explores how creative wellness, cultural identity, and lived experience can be powerful tools for healing and systemic change. As a performer, educator, and mental health advocate based in Providence, I’ve seen firsthand how storytelling and the arts can shift conversations around equity, education, and mental health.

This piece is rooted in my work with students, survivors, and community leaders. It’s not just about the arts; it’s about reclaiming voice, honoring truth, and building spaces where healing and leadership go hand in hand.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and ideas. How are you seeing creativity show up in advocacy or education? What does wellness look like in your community?

1m6g1c8,"Help! Why do I ""switch off"" and go too deep into my thoughts?","Hi, I’m trying to understand something I’ve experienced for a long time but never really had a full explanation for. I don’t think I have a dissociative disorder, but I do have trauma, depression, BPD, and ADHD. I take medication, and I know I’m mentally struggling, but this particular thing feels specific and frustrating.

I often zone out too deeply, and not in the casual “oops I forgot why I walked into the room” way (though that happens too). It’s more like this:

- I become extremely lost in thought.
If I’m doing something that doesn’t require constant focus, I'm bored or extremely stressed, or my body can do it automatically, like waiting, walking, dancing on autopilot, even studying, it’s like something switches. I drop into my mind, and everything else becomes blurry or frozen around me.

The weird thing is: I’m still conscious.
I know I’ve slipped into my head. I’m not unconscious or unaware, it’s like I’m watching the world from inside a glass room, but I’m not fully in my body. I have to be ""flipped back"" or snapped out of it.

- My thoughts never go blank, they get overwhelming.
Some people describe dissociation as “going empty” or mentally shutting down, but I feel the opposite. My mind becomes flooded. It's not one thought, it’s whatever my brain thinks is most appropriate to think in that moment: Memories, Fantasies, Regrets, sadness, Made-up conversations etc...
It’s not something I choose to do. Sometimes it happens in the middle of a dance practice or while studying, and people have to call me or tap me to pull me back because I’m just standing there, eyes glazed over. It’s embarrassing, and it makes me feel detached from everything.

- Emotionally, I feel both empty and overwhelmed.
There’s this paradox I keep feeling during these switches:
My body feels numb, but my heart aches.
I feel empty, but deeply distressed at the same time. One time I was waiting for a friend outside the bathroom. I slipped into my thoughts while waiting. When she came back, I snapped out of it and realized I was teary-eyed. I told her it’s
normal for me to think of sad things when I go into that state. It’s not even always on purpose. It’s like these switches are both my coping mechanism and my tormentor. They sometimes help me get through boring moments, but they mostly leave me drained, emotional, and disconnected.

[ Other Context: I have trauma and emotional dysregulation from BPD, ADHD, I take psych meds,i  feel numb often, but my thoughts race, even when I’m shut down, It doesn’t feel like full-on dissociation (like memory loss or identity confusion), but it feels deeper than ""just daydreaming""


Has anyone else experienced this?
Is this a trauma response, a form of dissociation, ADHD zoning out, or something else entirely?

1m6lsei,"I hate the career I chose: Medicine (final year, no motivation, no direction)","I’m a guy from a small town who moved to the city to study medicine. I didn’t choose it out of passion, but more like a personal challenge. I liked biology, health, fitness, and I was also attracted by the prestige of being a doctor. My parents made sacrifices to pay for a year of prep school. I got in, ranking in the top 10 out of almost 400 applicants.

The first two years were during the pandemic. I lived alone in a terrible apartment with loud neighbors. I couldn’t sleep or study. Money was tight. My dad couldn’t help me much more. I started getting physically and mentally sick. I felt like a caged animal, isolated, with no friends.

Every year I had a breaking point. I felt I couldn’t go on. I talked to my father, but he never supported the idea of quitting. So I just kept going, obediently, hoping to make him proud.

In 2023, my mom passed away from cancer. It shattered me. I wanted to return to my town and live a quiet, boring life. Medicine had stolen my peace. People who haven't studied medicine don’t understand the constant stress, the mistreatment, the egos. It drains your soul.

That same year, I met a girl in my class. We studied together every day. She became my anchor. I even lived with her for six months. I fell in love, but I didn’t realize it at first. Out of fear of commitment, I told her I wasn’t ready for anything serious. That pushed her away. Later I realized how deeply I cared, but it was too late. She left for her hometown to do clinical rotations and ended things.

Now I’m in my final year, and I hate everything about this path. I hate the pressure of having lives in my hands. I hate the idea of working in my hometown, afraid of harming someone I know. I hate being surrounded by illness and stress.

I told my dad I wanted to quit. We argued. He said that if I didn’t finish, all these years would be wasted. I begged for a break, but he never took me seriously. I’m exhausted, depressed, heartbroken. I feel like I’ve let everyone down.

I keep going just to get the degree. After that, I’ll see what to do. I considered switching to another field, like Agricultural Engineering, but I lost my father’s financial support and I’m not sure I can handle another 5-year degree.

All I want is a simple 9-to-5 job, maybe as an office clerk back in my town. A job where I can clock out and do the things I love: training, hobbies, having a dog. No more stress, no more fear of hurting people. I’ve developed a rejection to studying because of how much I suffered through it.

I also thought about working in a healthcare company or doing occupational medicine—something more administrative—just to avoid throwing all these years away. But honestly, I feel lost.

I’m in therapy, but it’s not enough. I feel like a 50-year-old divorced man stuck in the body of a 25-year-old.

1m6f9g3,Feeling guilty for doing better mentally while my friend is still struggling,"Sorry for the long post, but I guess that's what the venting tag is for lol.

So for context, I (F21) have struggled with mental health for well over a decade and most of my youth was stained by a myriad of bad episodes and dips in my mental well being. I met a lot of my now very good friends during those times and the reason we grew so close was because of our shared experiences of chronic struggle. I dropped out of high level studies in high school with one of these friends (NB21) for very similar reasons and we have shared almost the same journey with our mental health since then. 

Both of us had to fight to graduate high school and spent our gap years on disability aid just trying to survive and rest up. We have both been in therapy for years on and off and both of us are medicated. I have been lucky to have meds that have worked for me and therapists that have been tremendously helpful, my friend has had a lot more misfortune in their healing journey. They have cycled through countless of meds and countless of help offices, but it seems like their struggles are treatment resistant to a point.

So now we are in a situation where we both started university in fall of 2024 and while both of us have struggled with this new challenge, I have undoubtedly had more luck in adapting to the changes. For both of us the start of school was almost a blank slate, a start of a new era. My friend moved cities to start university and I also ended a three year relationship and moved on my own within that time (I had already lived in the city of the uni for a year before). 

Our stories started to diverge more as my turbulent autumn led me to put my healing and personal development on hyper speed, while my friend - away from their family and larger support system for the first time really - had a harder time. 

For the first time I was fighting my depression and anxiety with pure determination to get better (because I was not gonna let the other option happen). I started EFT tapping almost daily, I did shadow work almost religiously and I delved into my passions in a way I had never done before. My break up was able to give space for me to find my identity and use that to fight the demons in my head. I found something to live for. Something inherent to me. Something that I can trust wont be taken from me, because it's a part of me.

My friend has had their ups but mostly downs during this time. Luckily we are almost neighbors, so I am able to support them with ease and as my well being has improved, I have been able to be there for them more and more. But I can see that my improvement has an effect on them. I'm wondering if my better mental state is causing them to feel worse about their situation. We started from very similar places and of course it's so hard so see someone in a way leave you behind.

(And for the record, I love my friend to the moon and back. I would never leave them alone and will always be there to be their biggest support. They are my platonic soulmate and I stand by that.)

It is just that, their new reluctance and un-enthusiasm to hearing my accomplishments and all the good things happening in my life (active dating life, new hobbies and passions, new found confidence, etc.) is really starting to affect me too. I feel guilty for doing better and having treatment work for me. They have worked just as hard to survive, so why should they still be in pain?

1m6jzj5,Severe dissociation and loss of self - Need advice,"I'm experiencing severe dissociative symptoms that are getting progressively worse. Looking for others who've been through similar and found help.

**My symptoms:**

* Constantly watching myself from outside (like third-person view)
* When someone scolds me, I literally ""become"" them and lose my own perspective
* Internal voices/commentary on everything I do
* Can't access emotions - can't cry or laugh genuinely
* Memory issues and mood swings
* When I want to achieve something, internal voices immediately show me images of failure
* Feel guilty for wanting success, as if it's selfish
* Complete emotional numbness - feeling like a rock
* Watching myself watch the world (multiple layers of disconnection)

**Background:** Childhood trauma - parents fought violently, father had affair, physical abuse, extreme poverty, bullying at school. Worked hard to escape poverty, achieved some success, but then lost everything in failed startups and bad investment. The dissociation has gotten much worse since then.

**Current situation:** Found some mental health resources (NIMH Angoda, EMDR therapists) but feeling overwhelmed. The constant internal noise and disconnection from myself is exhausting. I know this started as a survival mechanism in childhood, but now it's destroying my ability to function.

Has anyone experienced this level of dissociation? What helped you? How did you find your way back to feeling like yourself? Any advice on approaching treatment or specific therapies that worked?

Ended up in the hospital for a few days because I had to lie to them and tell them I’m going to end my life if they don’t help me, and they finally gave me a benzo so the 16 hour panic attack I was having would finally go away. Since then, every time I have a panic attack they are weaker, to the point where I don’t have panic attacks anymore. Problem is, as the panic attacks would get weaker and weaker, the depression would get deeper and deeper. It’s like the panic attacks destroyed my limbic system and now I just feel nothing at all. I don’t know what to make of it. Someone could walk in my house and hold a gun on me and it probably wouldn’t phase me.

1m68z6u,Wife had mental breakdown and now is taking too much on emotionally,"My wife has sexual assaults in her past and also grew up in a very toxic household with a Dad who suffered from bipolar and a Mum who it sounds was suffering from something undiagnosed.

After caring for our two kids and caring for others in her job she burnt herself out and a few months ago, the past trauma was on her mind and she had a full breakdown that resulted in her being sectioned for a few weeks. The doctors did mention it was along the lines of a bipolar episode but they wouldn’t make this diagnosis unless it happened again. My wife was dead against this diagnosis and claims it was sleep deprivation that led to it. 

We pay privately for her to see a Psychologist to work through this and she seems to be benefitting from these sessions. 

My worry is that she is constantly surrounding herself with people who have past traumas and mental health issues to what I believe is an unhealthy degree. She watches YouTube videos about traumas and has been contacting people from her childhood who she believed might have had traumas. She believes she’s here to care for these people and that she has a deep understanding of mental illness. My worry is that she needs to care for herself and our girls first until she’s at a stage to take on so many other people’s pain. 

While I understand it’s good to talk through things. It’s fatiguing for me because it seems to be warping her world view. Hearing all the stories about sexual abuse is making her feel most men are abusive. Also depending on who she spoke to last is effecting how she sees herself. For example, she spoke to an old school friend who has autism and now she believes she has autism even though her symptoms don’t line up with that. 

She projected an autism diagnosis onto one of our children even though she’s a perfectly normal girl and there’s no signs of anything wrong. 

This is mostly just getting things of my chest. When I stated that I don’t think it’s a good idea to worry about labelling anything at the moment it led to an argument.

1m6i6mn,"Is there legal guidelines or assistance for SMI medical malpractice, medication mistakes?","During a 6 day hospital stay recovering from a spinal fusion (L3,L4,L5) 3 of my psych meds were naglected for 4 consecutive days, while under the influence of heavy narcotics, so it took me 4 days to know that that was what I was experiencing. I called them out and asked for a print out of everything that was given to me (when who and what med). They sent me home after only being on the correct regimen for only a day and a half, when skilled nursing was originally planned. Surgery was 45ish days early (rushed in) due to out of uncontrol pain for over a month (mentally debilitating). I made sure, provided lists and brought my home meds, because I knew the importance and the likelihood of the hospital not having certain medications stocked. I can keep going, but the constant traumatic experiences, worse than what led me to my relapse, most of 7 years of inpatient, 84 ECT treatments, throughout which I did gain 5 years of sobriety. But ive been my only cheerleader outside of my treatment team and thats why this is so hard. I've been working with my surgery team since 2019 when my treatments started. So they knew the fragility of my psychiatric needs and I was still naglected, and still am. Im homeless now, on disability, trying to learn how to be independent, and its impossible.  Compensation would help, but really what needs to happen is change. WE NEED to raise the success rate for survival throughout this broken world/system. I am why I made this far, but I need help. The hospital completed 3 investigations and still find themselves not at fault. I SH after being in remission for over 2 years (has been my go to 3× since, was tortured when inpatient psych without any pain meds 2 1/2 wks post-op(with absolutely zero orthopedic support,  what so ever), lived 3 days on a mountain before finding my way, but became stranded in a small town in an abusive, neglectful, transitional housing program claiming to help with mental health recovery along side of 97% of the ""centers"" population are recovering straight out of prison, fresh out of their addiction, dealing with CPS. All of which my trauma stemmed from which led me to my instatutionization, my gruesome, almost 10 year long recovery, all my personal growth in the last 2 years just trying (I NEVER STOP TRYING) to relearn my 90% memory loss due to all of the treatments in just a 2 yr period. I couldn't even process what I was looking at for months if not years (i dont remember, 😆) All of this work i have done, with my own amazing advocation skills, by myself, surviving the system, i will never add up enough in my mothers eyes to get my, now 13 yo daughter back. Who suffers dearly from mental health. I was adopted and an only child, so my mother and the rest of my huge adopted family, unfortunately extremely judgemental, who gossip, who will always see themselves above me and my 3 girls who struggle with mental health and addiction, simply due to the fact of misunderstanding and the stigma. I PROMISE YOU THIS!! I WILL NEVER STOP TRYING!! 
I need help because all the system wants to do is protect itself.

1m6hce4,I haven’t been able to follow storylines properly for 8 months. Is this a cognitive problem?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a problem that's been bothering me for quite a while. It's a bit hard to explain exactly what it is, but I’ll try to keep it short:

I've noticed an issue with my cognitive functions, and it's been going on for about 8 months now. Simply put, when I try to watch anime, a TV series, or play a story-based game, my brain just can’t seem to hold onto the information properly. I can retell the plot and what happened, but it's really hard to actually keep everything in my head while watching or playing — and if I try too hard, it gets overwhelming to the point where I feel like crying.

For example, imagine in the plot there was an event A, then B, then C, and the character’s goal was D. The problem is that I constantly have to replay A, B, and C in my head just to understand why D is even happening. And if I don’t do that — I simply can’t grasp what’s going on or what the point is. Even when I do get it, it doesn’t fully stick unless I mentally rewind and piece everything together again. I always have to go through that loop, or else nothing makes proper sense to me.

I’ve never had this kind of issue before. Right now, I’m 13 years old. I have no idea what could be causing it. It all started in the first month of winter, and it’s still happening now — and today is the 22nd day of the second month of summer.

I haven’t really tried to fix it or talked to any doctors. I’m writing this here just to maybe understand what the heck is going on, or if someone else has experienced something like this too.

If anyone knows anything or has gone through something similar, I’d really appreciate it if you could reply.

1m6fi62,Practical methods to alleviate work stress,"Something we all deal with at some point is the debilitating stresses of work.

It can come from an intense workload, the people you work with or another area of high-pressure or complex dynamics associated with the workplace.

In many circumstances, you can’t solve the root-cause problem of the stress, but you can manage how the stress impacts you.

I want this post to help you prevent stressors from becoming stressful or emotionally burdening. Putting you back in control of your mindset so you can enjoy your life outside of work and not feel like stress has control of your life.

Each of the challenges below provides real-world examples of how to identify stress and intentionally move from a point of stress to a calming, energy-balanced state.

\--------------

# Control > Influence > Accept Grid

Sorting worries into what you can control, merely influence, or must accept prevents wasted energy and channels effort into high-impact zones, reducing helplessness.

1. Draw three columns labeled Control, Influence, Accept.
2. List every current stressor under a column - be brutally realistic.
3. For each “Control” item, write one concrete next step (e.g., draft proposal outline).
4. For each “Influence” item, note one relationship-building or persuasive action (e.g., request feedback meeting).
5. For each “Accept” item, craft a short acceptance mantra (“Traffic happens; I breathe anyway”).
6. Review the grid nightly for a week, ticking actions completed; notice stress drop as clarity grows.

\--------------

# Three-Level Reframe Script

Reframing stressful thoughts at factual, emotional, and growth levels rewires the brain’s appraisal system, turning threat into challenge and fostering resilience.

1. Write one stressful thought verbatim (“My boss thinks I’m incompetent”).
2. Level 1 – Fact Check: List objective evidence for/against the thought.
3. Level 2 – Emotion Name: Identify and write the primary emotion (e.g., shame), then rate intensity 1-10.
4. Level 3 – Growth Lens: Rewrite the thought as a learning opportunity (“I’m gaining clarity on expectations and can ask for specific feedback”).
5. Read the growth statement aloud three times; notice emotion intensity drop.
6. Draft a micro-plan to act on the new frame (e.g., schedule feedback chat).

\--------------

# Stress Mapping Mind-Map

Creating a visual “map” of connected stressors externalises mental clutter and highlights leverage points, allowing strategic pruning instead of scattered fixes.

1. On blank paper, write today’s biggest stressor in the centre.
2. Draw branches for every contributing factor (people, processes, environment).
3. From each factor, branch out at least one practical mitigation idea (delegate, automate, renegotiate, adjust environment).
4. Circle mitigation ideas that are fully within your control—these are “green-light” actions.
5. Star one green-light action and schedule it (calendar invite, reminder).
6. Post the mind-map where you’ll see it tomorrow to reinforce follow-through.

1m6fcxx,i feel like i don’t deserve to be happy. please help.,"when i was a kid i may have done something to my sister that wasn’t sexual abuse, but crossed a boundary (took off her underwear during a game so her character could change sexes). i don’t even know if it happened (i have ocd). there were also some weird games we played that looking back match up with some of my kinks?

i’ve been told to forgive myself and move on but im still so scared. what if she’s traumatized because of me? im pretty sure she’d hate me for it if i brought it up now because she’s homophobic and i’m queer. my mother also seems to think i groomed her into identifying as queer when we were younger. also a therapist once said i shouldn’t be left alone around my sister because i said porn wasn’t all bad. 

i may have told my mom when i was a kid. she says she doesn’t remember me telling her. but she lies sometimes. 

i heard a friend talking about their sibling who abused them and how stressed they were around them and now i’m scared that’s how my sister feels. i know it wasn’t abuse but im scared. what if she thinks i don’t deserve to be happy and move on?

i want to cut, honestly. actually, i want to live a happy life, but i feel like i don’t deserve it. i’m scared to tell a therapist, even though ive been told it wasn’t sexual abuse and they won’t report it. (and if they did, i deserve it.) i don’t want to talk to my sister about it obviously because we have a shitty enough relationship. 

i want to just hang out with my friends, but i feel weird around them bc one of them said something kinda racist.

1m64pnk,"My mental health has improved drastically, and that's great, but now I feel like I don't know who I am","I've had severe anxiety my entire life and depression for the past 7 years. I got on Wellbutrin several weeks ago and three days ago it's like I just sort of ""woke up"". The anxiety was totally gone, like obliterated, I have no more racing thoughts, my mind is just empty unless I choose to think about something, I'm not depressed in any way whatsoever. I am so content and okay that I find it profoundly difficult to explain, just because it's not a feeling I'm used to.

But I don't feel like me. I lived in my head my entire life, yes my thoughts raced 24/7 and they were mostly based on fear and they caused me to suffer a lot, but in that disorganized thinking is where I found my creativity, I would write these long elaborate poems in the back of my head while five other streams of conciousness were also going at once and it drove me crazy but it meant something to me too, I've even put some of them in literary journals and things. They weren't mostly about anxiety it was just that anxiety made me think of them at such a rapid pace. 

And I'm used to feeling emotions so intensely. The deepest sadness and the peaks of joy, either one or the other, about everything. But now I just feel stable, only slight changes to my emotion at any given time and I get over them quickly. It used to be that one sad news headline would emotionally wreck me and one song I liked would have me jumping and screaming at the top of my lungs in glee. Obviously it's not really possible to function with mood swings that severe and that's why I got on medication. I could do without the depression and doom spirals. But I wish that I could get back going wild because of positive emotions, I wish that I could still have these strange, disorganized thought patterns that allowed me to make art the way I do, now I just feel like a zombie. A content zombie, but nonetheless.

I know it sounds ridiculous to complain about recovering from lifelong mental illness, and that most people would just be happy about getting their life back, and I am. I really do feel like I've gotten my life back. But I don't recognize myself anymore. I feel like the personality I used to have has just slipped out of my fingers like sand and washed away, and I'm nervous my friends and family will stop recognizing me too because even though I'm sure I was a burden on them when I was very depressed, I know that a lot of what my friends and family love about me is the wildness that for  three days I cannot muster up even though it used to show up at least once a day or more.

Later on after we broke up and remained friends, I apologised to her about this. She said she views it more as I convinced her rather than coercion. She told me that at the time she genuinely wanted to do it by them. She said I didn’t coerce her and that it was just an awkward moment that shouldn’t be repeated.

1m6eli9,What is wrong with me?,"I have in the past had mental health issues, in short I improved and was stable for a couple years and now I'm beginning to feel not that great again. I'm just going to list everything I am feeling/thinking, and as candidly as possible. Please give me your thoughts and feedback as to what this might be. 

- Hopelessness about my future/the world (since becoming a functioning adult and seeing the world as it is, I have come to realize that the life I had envisioned for myself will not easily come to fruition, and even through great effort the chances are slim. The US and the world as a whole is on a decline in my eyes, which only adds to said hopelessness). 

-Anxiety? (I have been diagnosed with depression 3 times by 3 different psychiatrists - three years ago - , not one mentioned me having any form of anxiety. Yet all I can do is worry - even when I'm in a good headspace. I stress about my finances, my family, my vehicles, etc. Normal things to worry about I guess, but I am plagued with thoughts of my parents or grandmother passing away, or a tree crushing my beloved Isuzu Amigo, or of myself dying in some freakish manner. I often imagine scenarios where these things happen in my head) 

- A severe lack of trust (I often think strangers or people I don't know very well will try to wrong me in some way, however illogical. I worry a lot more that people will try to steal or damage my property, and that I can not get it back.) 

- Difficulty controlling impulses for pleasure (Mainly in terms of sexual desire. I also smoke weed and vape, both of which I am well aware make things worse. Once I think about taking part in one of those things, there is nothing I can do to stop it generally. I am currently trying to stop using marijuana, but if someone passed me a blunt right now I would smoke it in a heartbeat. Weed seems to be the only thing that quiets my mind.) - (As well, if I like something, a hobby, music genre/artist, video game, etc, I will do that thing until I am utterly sick of it. The entirety of my free time will be taken up by that activity, nothing else. I tend to not find new ones either, I just repeat the cycle of media and entertainment) 

- Guilt (I feel guilty for doing the three examples above, because I know my family would be ashamed, and though I am not hyper religious I know God would be ashamed too. I feel guilty for how I treated my family in the past, and I feel guilty for how I am treating them now. Same with friends. I feel guilty about a load of things, and I know what I should do to  combat that guilt, yet I do not do it. I am ensconced in it. 

- People are no longer people (maybe a weird one. Sometimes I simply see humans as the animals we all are. I guess I always thought there would be a lot of good people in the world, that humans would be a little more human, being so above the rest of the creatures in this world. Then I hear the news, or have a bad interaction with a stranger. Maybe I just had too idyllic a view of how things worked, how people worked) 

There's more but I can't really put it into text, or talk about it much at all, simply because my brain blocks it out.

yes, in the past I've had suicidal contents, which is bad, but I feel like my feelings right now is worse than all of that combined. I've been addicted to marijuana for a year or so now, not terribly, but it's my 5th day in a row getting high. I'm not sure how to stop. 

on top of that, my life has been absolute jack lately. I got a girlfriend, but she doesn't understand how introverted I am and holds me accountable for not responding to text messages at times. I also lost my cat last week (?) which really hurt, and I'm still numb.

 my sister deals with psychosis/bipolar disorder and she recently, like, YESTERDAY recently had an episode at her boyfriends house. she took all of her pills (she had a 3 month supply of psychosis meds) and barely survived. she's unconscious in the ICU.

1m6dc4t,What is real - Coping with the confusion of reality with voices in my head.,"For a bit of background, I have had voices in my head ever since i was a young boy, and have always thought I was having my mind read. From this i have constantly been clasping at trying to understand the wider context of reality, one in which I am sectioned/forcibly injecting me with medication that I neither want nor think I need.  I am currently in hospital under section (for trying to talk to my parents about what is real) and they phycologist asked me to  write a short piece on what I thought could be real. Last night I was struggling with a what is real rabbit hole, and found reading through what I wrote to be helpful, so I thought I would share in-case the exercise appeals or helps anyone else. I have also posted to the Mental Health Forums, but no-one replied. Here is what I wrote:

  
I suppose I will start with my main perspective, that humans are predictive pattern matching flesh robots who like to find the 'truth'(in inverted commas due to the fact that this truth we are trying to find is a social one, one we can agree upon rather than an individuals truth). In doing this we have to explore not only the world around us, but delve into the machinery of the flesh and try to better understand its nuance and role in the discovery of a wider shared understanding. This is obviously a very complex thing to do, and in order to do so you would need to work through multiple different theories in order to pin down an understanding of even one individual, and the collision of these different theory's often leads to half truths or outright lies having to be used to help the pursuit. Within this framework we have built human systems that mimic the functioning of the human brain body and dance between individuals, such as the fake wars that for me represent slight and major depressions in the brain of human society. - This daemon has many faces and names.  
  
Now to the fun stuff:​

* The earth is conscious, and we are mealy part of its machinery, in order for the earth to achieve its goals it must lie and confuse its own machinery.  ​
* We live in a simulation (the shape of which I suppose is unimportant), within the simulation there is a framework in which individuals are welcomed into the thrall of knowing we are all in a machine of some sort. Hopefully, for narrative purposes, we are able to leave and explore other ways of existing once we are aware.  ​
* God hates the truth, it/she/he does not want to be known and would rather we suffer than know of its blunder in creating the universe (multiverse?).  ​
* We are multidimensional beings, what we experience is only the beginning of a wider opening into understanding the universe in a very different way, this notion is alien to the consensus reality of being a human, and we have designed systems to help others navigate this conundrum. The lie in this case I guess was to avoid me falling into the wrong perspective that could add years to me finding the tru tru.​
* Humans did not originate from Earth, and we are currently building society to allow the cultural formation of earth as a planet humans inhabit, the lie is to help us build up our own flavour of planet, before we are welcomed to the human network (spanning multiple star systems, perhaps galaxies?).
* Each human is in-fact just a manifestation of some other beings imagination, we are in-fact just metaphor, thought out by something.​ ",1,0,1753188915.0,mentalhealth,Smoking_Causes,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6dc4t/what_is_real_coping_with_the_confusion_of_reality/,2025-07-25T09:58:20.724300

1m695m5,Existential crisis and self harm urges,"29M. For a while now I'm struggling with finding any will to live. I wake up everyday and just don't want to exist. It's not like something is wrong in my life. I'm doing great in my career. Love life isn't great but it's mostly by choice. I've great friends. I travel and get involved in activities. Personally I've seen a lot of growth. I'm more confident and comfortable in my skin as I've ever been. I'm giving back to the people I love as well and I usually spend quality time with those around me.

I just don't have any will to live. I feel lost as soon as I'm alone with myself for a while. I've always been very comfortable being alone, I actually used to enjoy being alone. Lived 2 years of my life in a foreign city and didn't make much friends but had the best time of my life.

I started therapy and we couldn't find a source of this feeling of emptiness and giving up. I constantly spiral down and find myself unable to perform daily tasks or even get out of bed. I suspect I have ADHD (but that's another story). But now this has gotten to the point where I'm getting self harm thoughts, this is something new and never happened before. I'd be just chilling with my friends and talking and a part of me would just want to jump out the window and see how it feels. It doesn't even feel like I wanna s*icide. It just feels like my body wants to see how it would feel to jump from the 5th floor.

I've hurt myself recently in other ways as well and I didn't realise I'm doing self harm until a friend pointed out to me. He saw some scars and asked me what happened and I told him I did it myself for fun and to see how it feels.
Now I'm scared. Because the urge to jump is so high everyday and I can at times feel my body just too excited to jump. It feels like an attraction which isn't fully under my control and I'm scared.

i’d be making nearly the same amount if i quit my job and rely on government pay while i attempt to find remote work but i’m just so embarrassed to be somebody who has to rely on government aid for money when there’s people worse off than me who genuinely need it. 

i also am so scared ill be stuck without work forever. i know finding remote work is not easy and is in high demand. i have some knowledge, experience, and work with data analysis and i do graphic design as a hobby. i would love to find remote work doing something with either of the two but i just don’t know how realistic that is.

1m6d7ug,Prehearsing Conversations,"In another group, I recently posted about an experience that I had with trying to not prehearse a conversation. Someone in the comments said they also prehearse conversations. I've been doing this my whole life and always thought it was due to social anxiety. I never discussed this with my therapist because I found it embarrassing. I also worry that if people know then they will think I'm disgenuine. So, I've been trying to stop doing this unless it was for something important like training someone else at work, which is when I would assume you'd naturally prepare for a conversation in that context. 

But I discovered that I have the hardest time not prehearsing during times where I'm worried that I'll ""get in trouble"". Like if I forgot something at work so I'll suddenly be trying to map out the conversation so that I can explain what happened without too much pain involved. At first, I thought maybe I was doing this because I watched too much Court TV as a kid or too many true crime documentaries as a teen/adult. 

But now I think that maybe this is because I feel that I need to always justify my actions to or ""answer"" to someone else. I was wondering if anyone else is goung through this and if so, would you feel comfortable sharing what you think makes you do that?

1m5o9cj,I Haven’t Slept Since Thursday — I Cancelled a Protection Order Because She Has No One Else (Mental Health Crisis in Maine),"I haven’t slept since Thursday.

My long-time partner is in a full-blown mental health crisis—manic spirals, delusions, paranoia, refusing sleep, convinced people are hiding in the walls. She was recently arrested and jailed. And even after everything… I bailed her out.

I had filed a protection order. Things had gotten scary. But I canceled it. Because she has no one else. Her father left for another country six weeks ago—10,000 miles away—and hasn’t come back. Her mother emotionally checked out before any of this started. So it was either leave her in jail mid-breakdown, or take her back in myself.

Now she’s at my house, and I’m completely burned out. No sleep. No rest. She keeps the lights on all night. Makes me search the house. Breaks down crying. I love her. But I’m unraveling right next to her.

Before the arrest, we tried staying at her dad’s place in Fox Glove, Yarmouth (wealthy HOA neighborhood). That was the worst experience of all. She had a visible mental health episode outside. I called the police myself—for a mental health check. But the neighbors all came outside, staring, whispering, clearly scared of her. Some of them were on the phone too—talking to police behind my back, twisting the situation, trying to make her seem dangerous. Like we were criminals. Like she was a threat.

That was the last place she had to go. And they made it feel like a public trial. No support. No compassion. Just rich fear and social exile.

So now I’m here. Trying to hold her together. Trying to hold myself together. Our dog sleeps in the bed where she used to smile. Now it’s silence, shaking, and shadows.

If anyone’s ever had to carry someone through a breakdown—especially when you’re the only one left—I could use your voice. Or just a kind word. I’m not sure how much longer I can do this.

1m6c4x8,A Feeling of Nothing,"Hey everyone—this might come off as a random post, but maybe someone out there can relate. Or offer some kind of compass.

I spent most of my younger years in the Army infantry. Joined in 2008, deployed to Afghanistan a few times, and wrapped up my final reserve time in 2020. Life hasn't exactly thrown roses my way, but I kept moving forward. I always did.

Now I serve as a police officer. Different uniform, same battles—just with new rules and deeper shadows.

I’ve been married twice.
The first left me six months into my first tour—gone like I never existed.
The second found comfort in someone else's arms—also military, as if that makes it sting less.
I’m 37 now. No kids. No roots.

That’s just the backdrop.

Lately, I’ve felt... nothing.
Not anger. Not joy. Just this cold, quiet void.
Like I’ve been walking through fog for so long, I forgot what sunlight feels like.
I deal with everyone else’s chaos, their trauma, their loss—but mine? I bury it.
Deep.
So deep, I don’t even recognize it anymore.

No real family.
Co-workers I respect, but no one I’d call at 2 AM when the walls are closing in.
I spend most of my days with my headphones in my ears. 
I escaped the bad neighborhoods, the broken homes, and the generational curses by choosing the military.
But in choosing better, I also chose loneliness.
Solitude has followed me ever since.

I have a girlfriend now. She's amazing. Kind. Loving. Patient.
But I don’t know how to feel it.
Or return it.
I go through the motions like a man who remembers what love should look like—but not what it feels like.
If she disappeared tomorrow, I’d be disappointed... but the emptiness would still remain.

Every day feels like the previous.
Same street, same call, same bad guys, same heartbreaks.
Different names. Different uniforms. Same ghosts.

I don’t know what’s broken in me.
I just know I can’t seem to fix it.

Am I the only one who feels like this?
Is there a way back?
Or have I simply become a shadow of the man I once was?",1,0,1753185521.0,mentalhealth,WildMaintenance7379,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m6c4x8/a_feeling_of_nothing/,2025-07-25T09:58:22.232626
1m64ne5,I'm miserable but I never tell anyone,"I'm 17 years old and I'm going through a rough time. I want to tell my mom but even when I plan to do it it's like I just can't. It won't come out of my mouth even if I try to tell her.

I hold back tears for hours almost every day and then start crying the second I get into my room. I always hope someone would hear and check on me to find out I was upset so I wouldn't have to figure out how to express that something was wrong. It feels so stupid and attention seeking to just wait for someone else to notice without me having to say anything. I noticed I would start trying to cry quieter subconsciously when people came by my door like I didn't want them to hear but it's like I can't stop doing it.

I decided today I would let my mom know. If I couldn't tell her I would at least let myself cry in front of her so she could support me.

Yet, I let the whole day go by, feeling as miserable as usual. It was never ""the right time"" to tell her. And when I cried later, I heard her near my room door, but it was like I was rooted in place and couldn't go out there to ask for help. My stepdad even knocked on my door after and asked me if I was okay but I told him I was and when he asked if I had allergies, (he heard me sniffing) I took the excuse.

After that, I felt even worse. Why, even when I was given the easiest opportunity to admit to struggling, did I not do it? Why the hell does it feel like I want to ask for help so bad but my body doesn't? I'm angry with myself and still miserable, and I wish I could do something about it.

Edit: The other night my mom ended up coming back to my room with allergy meds since my stepdad told her I had ""sinus issues"". She could tell I was upset and I cried while she held me. It was nice, but I don't feel that much better about it, and I'm crying again. I didn't talk to her about it, just cried. She was sympathetic, but I don't know how to tell her it wasn't just that night and I've been sad for so long. She probably thinks something specific happened to cause it and I'll get over it soon. I wanted to tell her but I also didn't know how. I was shaking just from her finding out I was crying.

Edit #2: It feels like things have only gotten worse. Maybe it's because I wish I told her everything when I got the chance? Or the fact that I'm angry at myself again for saying yes when she asked if I was doing better, even though I'm not at all. The last couple of days I've cried upon waking up too.

1m6c3oh,I dont know how to feel,"Even though my (41F) husband (44M) said he was not in a hurry to file for divorce, he did on Tuesday 7/15/25. He said it just made sense because the next few weeks were going to be hectic and he was running errands anyway. On Friday 7/18/25 I packed up my car and my cat (who is now stressed and not eating) and moved in with my mother (temporarily). Husband is out of town on what was supposed to be OUR family vacation. Since my son (23M) and I were no longer invited, I did what I could to give him a vacation. We took a day trip to the beach the other day and went to the aquarium yesterday. I wish I could've done more, but sadly I can't afford it. Husband has all the vacation fund money. 

I dont know if it's because my Dr recently (Friday 7/18/25) added Prozac to my daily drug intake, or if I'm just still in a state of shock, but I dont feel anything. Shouldn't I feel something?

Finally managed to get appointment with psychologist, and yesterday we had a call. Well, I guess maybe I could share my thoughts with someone. But didn't hear much new tbh. Got recommended to visit psychiatrist and to go for CBT.

Tried practically all psychiatrists in my city (for therapy I need a paper from psychiatrist). Well, earliest possible appointment is in January. It's fucking laughable. Seems mental health is a luxury for me. 

At this point I think it would be better if I didn't go to psychologist yesterday, because at least I could lie to myself that it's a step in good direction. But now I'm officially out of hope.

1m6an4l,My partner struggles with his looks,"My partner goes through very low periods with his looks. He says he hates how he looks and thinks about it all the time - but sometimes there are periods where it is worse. These periods are triggered by taking a photo, looking in a mirror, uploading something to Instagram etc.

He was assaulted long before we met, and had his nose broken. It was repaired at the time, but this was more of a structural thing than anything aesthetic. He has had a few operations since, including one that was quite traumatic. They have used cartilage from elsewhere in his body in the end, to give his nose structure.

He is very unhappy with his nose, but to me, it just looks like a nose. A very cute one at that. I don't believe anybody would ever know he's had any work done.

He wants to have another operation, and has approached his previous doctor, but it would be expensive and suggested the operation would be risky, as there is so little left to work with after all the previous operations, and that it may end up looking worse. He was advised that if they did operate, there would never be another operation afterwards, as there would be nothing left that could be done.

I personally feel like his nose looks just fine as it is, if not better than fine! I've always said this to him when he asks, but I can never convince him enough to influence his own feelings about it.

I personally feel like the problem is not with his nose, but about the assault and the fact his looks have been changed against his will.

I don't think they've operation would be the right thing, as I think he will still be unhappy with the next nose. And it a huge expense that neither of have the money for, with a high risk that the operation will go wrong. 

I personally believe that he should seek some counselling or therapy to come to terms with how he looks, rather than chasing how he used to look. I've tried to suggest this carefully, but it is a delicate subject and he hasn't shown much interest.

If an operation is the best option, I will start saving to help him out. But I really deep down just don't feel like that's the case, but it's difficult for me to articulate my concerns to him as it's such a delicate topic.

I'm open to any advise on how he, or indeed I, should proceed.

1m64far,I’m struggling to move on from a breakup and rebuild my life.,"
I was in a relationship for about two years. The first year was honestly beautiful,
we were happy, had financial stability, traveled a lot, and shared genuine excitement about the future. But slowly, we began enabling each other’s unhealthy habits. He started doing a lot for me, and I became emotionally dependent. Eventually, I lost sight of myself. I stopped working, didn’t want to go out, and just wanted to be with him all the time.

Both of us ended up drifting away from our individual paths. He fell into debt, I put my career aside, and we found comfort in the bubble we built together,
even if it wasn’t sustainable.

One day, he decided to change. He set boundaries, leaned on therapy and his friends, and started pulling away from me. I became extremely anxious, and eventually… he left.

Since then, I’ve been very low. Depressed, if I’m being honest. I’m in a country where I haven’t been able to find work or stability, and going back home isn’t really an option because of family expectations and pressure.

I feel stuck. I know I need to get my life back on track, but I don’t know where to start. I don’t feel confident in myself. I’m scared. But I don’t want to give up either.

1m66k97,Can someone please help me figure out how to stop this so I don’t have to deal with these thoughts ?,"

I get random periods of obsessive thoughts about really specific friends or people in general… I think I can recall some of these happening when I was younger, but I can’t remember anything right now. But my current situation is I’m currently constantly thinking about a specific person and genuinely it’s affecting my perception of things in a way. This is just one of those kinda obsessive thought periods, I guess. Im gonna try to explain this the best I can. 

This person is someone who im not closest with, but we’ve talked enough to the point of friendship, id assume. I’ve been thinking about them a lot and it’s more so social media related. I believe this started arising in April. I was constantly checking their account to see if they had still kept me in their close friends, I was constantly thinking about them, I was just feeling weird. Later maybe in may the second I notice my follow count go down, I’d frantically scroll through to make sure they were still there if I had no prior evidence to show they still had me followed back. The day I was off their cfs I immediately noticed it too and it made me feel sick, which I had to convince my mind I was over since they had very limited space in their list. I can’t stop thinking about them in random moments and worrying about what they think of me. I don’t know if it’s just social media getting inside my brain or not but if there is a way I can genuinely stop these thoughts would help.

1m66arg,Horrible experience hospitalized at IMH (Singapore),"Hi all,

I came out to my parents as trans this March, and my mom basically ignored it and pretended I didn't come out at all. Since then, my depression has returned in full-swing.

So I've been hospitalized at IMH twice (EPIP Ward) this year, a 10-day stint in May and since 30th June till now, I have been warded again. Discharge is arbitrary and unclear.

I've been on meds since 2019, on at least 10 different anti-depressants, and they have not worked for me. Yet IMH still insists on trying medicine after medicine. And most of these medicines have bad side effects (headaches, stomaches, nausea, fatigue etc.) I still feel depressed, still have no motivation or purpose for my life, still have no energy to do things.

When warded there, there is essentially nothing to do there but walk around, sit down, eat, sleep. You are treated like a pig there.

Doctors only meet you every Mon, Wed, Fri. There are no treatments done on weekends. And sometimes, the doctors don't even show up till one week later. This hospitalization, I met the doctor on Wed, and then only the next Wednesday after.

Everyday, you are stuck in purgatory, not knowing your treatment plans, when can you get discharged, etc. etc. There is a lot of miscommunication and uncertainty.

Other than the meds, IMH tells me to ""just do it"" when it comes to tasks i need to do, aka ""force yourself to do it"".

My depression is mainly caused by my emotionally abusive family. They have been like this since I was a child. They have seen the family therapist, but still don't change. IMH acts like my parents are the authority on my wellbeing and insists on trying to fix my family back as a happy unit. Well, it's just not going to happen.

I sincerely believe that if I have a safe place to stay, away from my parents, where I can live independently and begin to recover enough to earn money independently to afford a single room apartment of my own, I will no longer be depressed or at least not as depressed as now.

TL:DR Professional help has failed me, social services have failed me, parents have always been failing me, I don't have any friends or relatives I can turn to, what should I do?",2,0,1753164032.0,mentalhealth,Specific_Skill591,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m66arg/horrible_experience_hospitalized_at_imh_singapore/,2025-07-25T09:58:22.232626

1m694l6,Unspecified disorder or possible masking ?,"It's very hard to describe this, but basically, whenever my body sees a person of a specific sort, I (unintentionally) put on masks that have different personalities or genders?

It's very hard for me to just 'be myself' because, for say, sometimes I see a pretty lady or even a girl my age (I'm 12), my nervous system put on a weirdly... manly mask? Like, I (untintentionally) put on a personality that is more masculine to make them like me romantically. But I would never like them back? And sometimes, I would see a man or boy my age, and put on a more feminine mask, act all feminine like twirling my hair and looking pretty, and my instincts tell me that I want them to like me. But I would never like them back! It's so weird.

I can also put on a mask with a specific mood and/or gender? I don't know how to explain it in a sense that anyone who is interested in the LGBTQIA2S+ community or psychology (like I am) would understand. Sometimes, I go: 'I'm feeling silly. Why don't I just be agender for a bit and exist as a human,' or sometimes it's 'I'm feeling a bit dainty. Why do I suddenly want to look like Mana Sama?' 

I don't know what part of disorder or result of trauma this is, or even if it's under the LGBTQIA2S+ umbrella. I don't have very major trauma, just a bit of teasing from kids older than me and being exposed to explicit content as a young child.

What about when I meant a dude online I was 15 he was 23. He always said that being together with him was fate I blocked him on everything but he kept coming back.

Or another guy when I was 16 and he was in his early twenties and told me if I give him a blowjob he'd buy me a vape (I didn't do it)

Or how about the 51-year-old I met on the internet when I was 13 who showed me his entire body.

1m62ycs,17years old. Poor sleep is seriously taking a toll on my mental. Does anyone have advice on how to optimize deeper sleep?,"little context on my situation : I am 17 years old, I go to the gym 5-6x a week participating in resistance training, and currently bulking while eating a very very clean animal based diet with absolutely no processed foods (lots of red meat, eggs, healthy fats, etc.) . I supplement with creatine, zinc, and I take 500mg of magnesium glycinate before bed. I put electronics down around an hour before bed, and I wear blue light glasses around an hour or two before bed so I don’t disrupt the production of melatonin. Overall healthy lifestyle, I get lots of sun in the day and have been trying my best to maximize my testosterone levels in every way possible. Despite all my efforts, what is holding me back is my terrible quality of sleep. 

I aim to get 8 hours of sleep daily for ideal hormone production and muscle recovery, but something always stands in the way of it. Its been a while since I had a full 8 hours of sleep without any interruptions. Either I wake up randomly, 1-3 times at night, need to go to the bathroom very early in the AM, have lots of trouble falling asleep, or overall feeling a strong lack of good quality deep sleep. I don’t understand, despite having such a healthy lifestyle and trying to ‘testmaxx’ as many say, how come I am getting such shit sleep? It is and has been genuinley exhausting having to put up with this every single night. I can be doing everything right to optimize my testosterone levels in terms of diet, training, habits, etc. but if my sleep isn’t good, then its all pointless.  

If somebody can please help, I do believe that I have tried everything. Whether that is taking 600mg of Magnesium Glycinate before bed, Ashwaganda, Blue Light Glasses, Melatonin from natural sources like grapes, low temperature room for ideal sleep, sleeping close to the circadian rhythm, walks to lower cortisol before bed, litterally nothing works and its mentally taking a toll on me and hindering both my progress in the gym and my efforts for trying to achieve healthy testosterone levels. I have never had issues with sleep, this is fairly recent, maybe the past 2 months has been like this for me, and I dont understand. I am desperate for answers and need help please somebody.

On the outside, I'm normal. I'm quite social, doing good in school, got into a great uni, have a close group of friends and loving family. 

On the inside, however, my brain is a mess. 
Sometimes it's manageable, but sometimes it feels like I'm a complete monster. There's so much messed up shit going on I don't even know where to start. For example: When I read or hear about someone having a trauma, I sometimes have this feeling/thought ""I wish that happened to me"". I find myself sometimes in some weird way wishing to have some illness or health condition, and I don't fully understand why. Maybe it's because I want care and attention, or to feel ""special"", and I hate that my mind even goes there because it's such a messed up feeling to have. I don't even have a reason to feel this way because my parents were always very loving and caring. 
I also worry that I might be a covert/vulnerable narcissist. I read about the symptoms and a lot of them seem to fit me.
On top of that, I have messed up fetishes that I find repulsive and immoral.
My brain gets stuck in OCD-like loops for weeks, mostly thinking about how bad of a person I am, the things I listed above, but also other morality-related stuff like social justice. It doesn't even feel like it could be OCD anymore because it's all connected to real events, things I do or did, or the things I talked about here that are happening in my brain.

1m64krc,is it normal for my friend to hit me to the point where I'm genuinely quite hurt??,"i had a can of monster (the energy drink) at school today. I let some people have some because-well..i dont really like saying no to people. The can was basically empty and one of my best friends kept asking for the can. I repeatedly tried saying no-(i wasnt that firm about it because i still struggle with saying no, though i am getting better at it.)-but he just wouldn't stop. He then proceeded to just hit my arm and torso with a rock he had in his hand and it genuinely hurt. Unsure if it left any marks because i had a jacket on, but it did hurt. I tried saying it was hurting me and to please stop..i ran away a couple times and went by some other people in my class-they all just thought we were messing around i guess..we kinda were, but it hurt..? He never said sorry and kept hitting/grabbing me and it honestly hurt...I dont know how to tell him how that made me feel, though. It's been happening for a while, like when he used to have a metal drink bottle and hit me with that. I guess its sort of become normalized??? But this time it really hurt. I dont know what to do to get him to stop..hes a few months younger than me but he genuinely scares me sometimes. He just kept hitting me repeatedly and I felt so helpless. I think i remember him saying something like ""give me the can and I'll stop hurting you."" I ended up just giving him the can because I was done. I'm usually not aloud monster but I got one this time so i guess thats why I wanted to keep it? Then him and somebody else basically just called me helpless. I flinch all the time around him and he kinda makes fun of me for it and wonders why I always flinch whenever he walks past/behind me or raises his hand. Well, I guess this is why. I also always forgive him for EVERYTHING and yeah. I'm actually just kinda getting sick of it. If i sightly hurt him or say something its kind of a big deal..he gets mad at me, most of the time hurts me-(verbally and physically-calls me useless and stuff or just hits me.)-but i always forgive him no matter what. Just wondering if this is normal and i deserve it or if this isnt normal...sorry for talking so much just wanted to get that off my chest. Any advice/answers/experiences are highly appreciated.

1m61qpn,Do you think this constitutes trauma?,"I have this vivid memory from when I was about 3 or 4. I remember my mother threatening to kill herself. It wasn't so direct as that. She said she would go to the (local) river and not come back. She actually left the house for a while. I guess even though I was very young I understood what that meant because I remember being hysterical. My father and older siblings didn't seem to care because I think it had happened a few times.

I live with a lot of fear. It's shaped my life pretty much. I'm trying to make sense of it. Not in a ""it's all someone elses fault"" sort of way just in a soul searching sort of way.

I would say I'm at rock bottom right now if I didn't firmly believe there's always a rockier bottom.

Do you think what I described could be childhood trauma? I've never brought it up with a therapist. I haven't been to therapy in a long while but I plan to start again.

1m5q789,"I was sexually abused, I hope you can read me.","I don't know how explicit Reddit or the community will see this, I don't know if they'll take down my post, but it's the first time in my life that I've analyzed and started talking about this sad experience I had when I was just a child and to this day I haven't been able to assimilate.

Well, this is the first time I'm talking about this topic, and unfortunately, I was sexually abused multiple times when I was just a child. They weren't false memories as I thought. I think it was simply that, as a result of that trauma, my brain has blocked those bad memories until today.

It's sad that a child has to go through that, but strangely, I feel like what happened to me doesn't affect me and I overlook it ¿Is it normal for me to ignore the fact that I was abused? It's like a mechanism that makes me block out the bad feeling of feeling frustrated by being abused, and what really makes me sad is that I was a helpless child who grew up without the proper protection of my parents. Well, I lost my father at an early age, and I had to grow up with a single mother who worked and studied at the same time to give me the best. The worst part is that when I say that my whole life I felt vulnerable and helpless, it's because when I was a child and I no longer liked what the person was doing to me, I told them with tears in my eyes in a few words that I was abused. I didn't say it explicitly, but I gave signs. No one took it seriously, no one gave me comfort, no one supported me, they forgot about it the next day ¿And you know the worst part? I grew up normalizing what happened to me, to the point that to this day I treat the person who sexually abused me as if nothing had happened. I treat him like a lifelong friend, because the one who did it is my mother's cousin.

I grew up in a sexist environment where if I told my experience as a man who was abused, they would most likely make fun of me.

That's why I ask you, not about how normal it is that I have normalized that I was sexually abused and let it go as if it were nothing, what I hate the most is that I don't have the courage to confront the person who did it and the most regrettable thing is that now I have to reminisce about it all my life and do absolutely nothing, I don't even hold a grudge, but it makes me a little bad knowing that I was abused and nobody did anything for me, THAT'S WHAT HURTS ME THE MOST, it should be noted that he did it, he was a teenager, I don't know how normal that is, but well, that's my story, it's the first time in my life that I dare to tell this case explicitly, I hope for your best advice and support, thank you for reading.",14,12,1753121080.0,mentalhealth,Cry_lastest,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m5q789/i_was_sexually_abused_i_hope_you_can_read_me/,2025-07-25T09:58:22.232626
1m67ptx,A New Way to Understand Depression – The “Stress Triangle” (Not Medical Advice),"I’ve been exploring a model I call the **Stress Triangle** — it’s a simple way to visualize how depression can feed on itself. Think of it like the **fire triangle** (fuel, heat, oxygen), but for stress.

The three parts are:

* **Cortisol (🔥)** – the stress hormone that affects mood, sleep, and memory.
* **Stressful Thoughts (🌬️)** – negative loops like “I’ll never get better.”
* **Painful Memories (🪵)** – unresolved experiences that fuel the system.

Each one amplifies the others. A bad memory triggers thoughts, which raise cortisol, which then strengthens the memory loop. Break one corner, and the triangle weakens.

This isn’t a replacement for therapy or meds, but it might help explain **why it’s so hard to “think” your way out of depression**—because the stress response is doing more than just affecting your mood.

Would love to hear your take on this model.

  
Edit: the Stress Triangle model is a simplification of depression and is used to represent stress and how that can become a system with interactions which amplify each other. To model depression with the Stress Triangle, further mechanics and models are required, including (but not limited to) the Polyvagal Theory and HPA axis dysfunction.

**Disclaimer:**

This is for **educational purposes only** and is **not medical advice**. The Stress Triangle is a conceptual framework, not a clinical tool. Always talk to a qualified healthcare provider for mental health concerns.

While the stress triangle is my own concept, this post was created through AI.",1,17,1753169429.0,mentalhealth,zomby_jon,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m67ptx/a_new_way_to_understand_depression_the_stress/,2025-07-25T09:58:22.232626
1m67lz8,Never feeling good enough?,"I (26F) have felt this way for as long as I can remember. My self-esteem has never been the highest, especially during the typical time period in my middle/high school years. However, I’ve felt that in recent years I’ve really worked on myself and my mental health and just felt like I was in a better place overall in my adult life. I’m currently 4 weeks postpartum and I can feel all these old negative feelings that I thought I was over slowly starting to creep up and are heightened because of the hormonal roller coaster I’m dealing with right now. 

The most persistent one is not feeling good enough, especially for my bf. We grew up together and have always been best friends, and while we definitely had our crushes on each other back then, we never really acted on them until after we graduated. We both saw different people throughout high school and we both needed to grow up a little bit before getting together because we both knew we would be in it for the long haul- he’s always been my person. However, there was a lot of him breaking up with his ex and then coming to me and we’d be talking as if we’re gonna be together and then suddenly dropping me and getting back with her. Typical high school shit. It’s so childish and stupid, but I think that’s where my feelings about not feeling good enough have stemmed from when it comes to him and our relationship. Cause I remember back then feeling like he would always choose her (or someone else) over me. 

I’d like to clarify though, we’ve had many talks about this over the last 10 years of us being together. He’s apologized and explained his viewpoint, I’ve explained mine, and we both understand each other. We were dumb high schoolers trying to figure out life. Which I think makes it even harder for me feeling this way because I don’t hold any of it against him? And I kinda feel bad for feeling this way and having all that stuff from the past weighing on me right now after having our deep talks about it early on in our relationship. 

Part of me wants to bring it up to him. Mostly to get some type of reassurance I guess? But then the other part of me is like girl, get it the fuck together please, you just had a baby together, the man’s not going anywhere. But no matter how many times I remind myself of that, or he reminds me that this is a forever thing, there’s still that little girl that feels like the rug is gonna be swept out from under me any minute.

1m67cpz,Am I in the wrong??? (!! might be triggering for some people !!),"You read the title! (I hope you did-) !!ALSO, THIS IS PART ONE!! PART TWO IS IN MY NEXT POST DUE TO THE CHARACTER LIMIT! <3 Time to tell me if im in the wrong because I suck at being assertive in situations lmao. I also suck at knowing whats okay and whats not. I thought my friends behaviour was completely standard, (or for the most part.) but people with more experience and assertiveness told me otherwise. (AAAARRGHHHH HES BEING SO NICE AND TEXTING ME SWEET STUFF NOW THIS IS WHY I QUESTION IF IM IN THE WRONG SOBB i really enjoy his company and honestly I deserve to be hurt-)  ANYWAYS...time for the internet to judge if im in the wrong in this situation! Any advice or experiences are much appreciated <3

Continuing off of my last post, where one of my best friends kept hitting me with rocks because i wouldnt give him my drink: I texted him- letting him know that it hurt and I didnt enjoy it. (btw this was all over text. He went on to ask if he could have this pet rock i have so he could hurt himself. (big detail that he said the reason he wanted to was so he could 'make it even') I told him no because i dont want him hurting himself obviously. He said ""Ugh this is why I didnt wanna tell you"" (for context he was asking if he could have the rock but not telling me why) and then he went to tell me how he knew where he could find rocks and he could just use another one. I then told him it was **his** decision to hurt me, therefore if that was his motive for hurting himself, he couldve just not done it-that was his fault for hurting me. he told me he could just do it while i wasnt looking and then said ""And plus what're you gonna do to stop me? Hm?"" I was so tired at that point. why had he turned it on me like that? how did it go from me telling him i didnt enjoy him hurting me to him saying he's gonna hurt himself because of that??? So i just responded with this: ""The truth is, I cant. its your decision to know whats best for you. maybe its better if i dont interfere with it if youre not gonna even try let me help.."" I think that was a pretty reasonable answer on my part. Lmk if it wasn't and I'm in the wrong, though, please. I half expected for him to understand. stop, and realize this conversation wasnt right. Nope. He continued..""You're not even gonna try to stop me?.. Well that takes the fun out of it- I wanted it to be a challenge..Buutttt..It's gonna be easier-"" I felt bad while feeling sick because why had this suddenly been turned on me..? He asked if i could try to stop him but at that point i was DONE. ""youre acting as if ive not always tried to stop you whenever you say youre gonna hurt yourself. Yeah, i **do** try. Literally every time you say youre gonna hurt yourself.."" He told me he knows and likes that I try, then said he likes challenges, as if this was some sort of game to him-worrying me sick when he'd pull this shit. ""oh yeah and i sure do LOVE desperately trying to convince you not to hurt yourself."" I felt like I was standing- (check my next post for part 2 please!!)

1m67abc,"To the overlooked/ignored, I see you.","I just want to say something that’s been on my heart.

This is for the people who get talked over, the ones who are always nice but somehow still get pushed to the side. The ones who aren’t loud or flashy, but who feel everything deeply. The ones who say “buddy” or “hey man” just to try to connect. The ones who probably got bullied, but still treat everyone with kindness.

You might not get the attention. You might not get the credit. But I see you.

You’re the kind of person who makes others feel safe to be themselves. You don’t put on a fake act. You don’t try to be someone else to impress people. You just are.

It hurts when others ignore you or talk behind your back. When people mistake kindness for weakness. But don’t let this world convince you that being soft, weird, awkward, or emotional is a flaw. It’s not. It makes everyone else like you feel like they can be themselves.

Don’t change. Don’t shut down. Don’t let the coldness of others freeze the warmth in you.

I don’t know who needs to hear this, but the world desperately needs more people like you.

Even if no one’s said it lately:

School made me keep going and gave me purpose so I was pretty distracted from this but since summer started I think I’ve hit the lowest of lows I’ve ever been at.

1m66w63,Undergoing ECT. Have I been robbed?," Hi All, Im 33(M) from Sydney Australia and i am currently undergoing a course of ECT as an inpatient at a mental health hospital.

My history is quite long but let me just summaries it for you, I've struggled with my mental health since I was 17 in my final years of schooling. I finished but didn't get very good grades so my first year after school I just worked odd jobs here and there. I suffered mainly with depression. 

When i got to about 21 I noticed that I started to hear things that no one else could, a woman speaking to me, at first it was like a normal conversation but then it turned nasty. I was then diagnosed with psychotic depression. 

Years went by and it went from psychotic depression, to bipolar type 2, until it finally landed on schizoaffective disorder. In-between a lot of things happened. I got married, was studying at university and doing quite well until 2017 when my voices started getting nasty and my mood rapidly declined. 

Since 2017 I have been in and out of Hospitals so frequently that I cant actually count the admissions (i forgot). I've also been on a long list of medications that have failed to help me. 

Currently I am in a mental health hospital undergoing ECT (started yesterday) and was just pondering that I don't really think Im suited to my current job (cant say what it is). At uni I studied Chemistry and Biology and loved it but became unwell during it so had to stop. 

Have i been robbed in life? Do you think its possible to start over? Go to uni all over again? I think if I want to go back my wife would support me but I'm not sure what other people would say. I feel like I have been robbed of my life by my mental illness.

1m66ryd,post partum depression,"hi everyone. i’m deciding to post here because i guess i need words of encouragement or just somewhere to write and let someone know what’s going on. i had prenatal and i now have post partum depression. my daughter is almost 9 months old and i couldn’t imagine a life without her and i can’t bare the thought of me leaving this world and leaving her here alone.. 
this is really hard.
i want to tell my story.
my depression began when i was around 11 after my older sister dies. i can only imagine what my parents went through. they had just gotten divorced the year before but that didn’t cause me any turmoil, i was old enough to understand what happened. anyways my moms demeanor completely changed and she became bipolar (diagnosed but untreated) and i would say depressed as well. 
money started becoming more of an issue and into highschool it got worse. she runs a food truck since around 2013 and that’s all she talks about and it’s basically her life just work work work. i was always there after school helping as cashier. 
anyways i guess not being able to talk to my mom about anything without getting yelled at about how much and how hard she works (even when i was like a freshman in hs and couldn’t even work) was deteriorating my relationship with her. i just wanted her to help me with my homework sometimes or just tell her about my day with my friends but it always turned back to work. anyway time goes on im out of hs and start dating my now baby’s father. my mom and i had a “falling out” i guess you could say and we didn’t talk for a long time. when we would talk it was always arguments about me coming home late etc,. one day idk we just started talking and i started helping her at the food truck again. this was about 2/3 years ago? things were iffy with my baby’s dad we were on and off then we’re together again for about 4 months when i got pregnant and just stayed together after. things got i would say good with my mom but money is still an issue. well my baby’s dad… we moved in together to my moms house and that’s when it got horrible. he basically emotionally cheated on me by texting this one girl idk, and then constantly just watching porn like driving while watching porn livestreams, while i’d be texting me what he wanted to eat after work. keep in mind we were having almost sex every day while i was pregnant. it makes me so sad to think about. well i ended up finding porn i didn’t agree with and a secret instagram acct that he used to watch porn accounts. and who was on there?? my sister. he was following my sister on the same account he used for porn. also saving and watching her videos on tiktok. as well as screen recording stories my aunt would post with videos or pics of her. as wellll as using my ipad to look at photos of her while i was working with my mom in the evening while i was pregnant. oh and may i mention? while she was on the other side of the wall. i was and still am completely confused, shattered, disgusted, i have no other words. i will finish writing in comments.

1m66hv1,Time is going too fast and my body feels old. Here's some things if u wanna listen. I'm struggling,"Rant time



Hi im Dylon. Im about to be a senior in highschool. I've been dealing with this since freshman year. I have debilitating sometimes physical anxiety and pain on my left side and the area is always sore it hurts so bad. The muscles there are always so tight and I'm always in an anxious mindset I really can't sleep well or think well or live well and it's almost impacted every moment of my life. My vision is blurry and static and hazy, I have visual snow pretty good. I used to do a lot of psychedelics and cough syrup and be a pothead. But I hate weed now after the horrifying panic attacks I would get. I've been dealing with this for years now, everyday being a struggle sometimes barely being able to function. I don't know how I've gotten girlfriends or have had sex or even gone out. I guess I go into autopilot. Fell in love with a girl, cheated on me a lot, still love her to this day, she came over just today and after she left I was smelling my blankets missing how she used to treat me. I have a hard time focusing in school, I'm always just blasted into my music thinking. Music is one of my only comforts. I get hot flashes, and chest tightness so severe that I feel like I can't even breathe. Some really crazy shit has gone down. My dad left my mother, one of my grandma's died, I've had a lot of people betray me, and not understand me. My brain is so foggy sometimes I really feel braindead. My only escape is my guitar and a pen and paper and watching YouTube and movies. I have a best friend who has been there for me for 10 years but he can be a dick sometimes but I love him to death. Another one of my passions is collecting vintage dolls and CDs. It's comforting. I've hurt people too it's not like I'm innocent. I wish I could just feel like how I did when I was 13 again. I also have a pretty bad s*x/ p*rn addiction and a nicotine addiction. I've struggled with that since 8th grade. Was smoking cigarettes for a pretty long while and vaping on and off and now I've fully switched to vaping and quit cigarettes and I do those dumb zyn pouches sometimes but those usually make me feel sick. My mother is a single mom struggling. My dad is an alcoholic who's girlfriend just died of a massive heart attack. And before my eyes I'm becoming an adult when I still feel like that trapped 13 year old. I have no motivation to do much at this moment. I'm in a haze of static and colors and thinking. Sorry if this isn't very focused my thoughts are not well constructed at all right now. I'm sorry for anyone who took the time to read all of this. I just needed to type it out..and this is barely scratching the surface. But thanks for anyone who did read. I wish I could get into therapy and things. My family is just broke.

1m627p2,hyperfixations.,"does anyone else get really awful hyperfixations? i’m sure the reason why mine are so bad right now is because my anxiety and ocd has been heightened as well, but, i literally feel like i’m loosing my mind… my current hyperfixations is the video game/tv show, the last of us… when i’m awake, i watch edits of it, and roleplay with characters of it on rp app (bad i know), and i feel like i’m physically loosing my mind without it… a lot of the times when i roleplay about it, i make my character and the character i’m writing with have or eventually have a relationship, and it hurts me physically inside that i’ll never have the type of relationship with a real person… i’m scared i’m going to loose my mind, or go to deep into this fixation…

it does sometimes make me upset and anxious when i think about stuff like this, when i feel like i’m so deep into the hyperfixation that i can’t pull myself out… i used to hyperfixate about different things too (harry potter, teen wolf, crisis l minds, etc.) but, it was mostly just never shutting up about it, it wasn’t me feeling like this physically… maybe it’s because of the app i’m using that makes the ‘perfect relationship’, but, it fucking sucks and i don’t know how to pull myself out of it…

i really don’t want to start avoiding everyone tlou, because parts of it does make me happy, and i do enjoy watching the edits and writing, but, sometimes it makes me feel insane… any advice would be super super appreciated, or if anyone has any similar stories that would be great too! thanks in advance! 🩷",2,4,1753150898.0,mentalhealth,sadielaplante,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m627p2/hyperfixations/,2025-07-25T09:58:22.232626

1m66cq9,Reminder that you guys got this :),"Hey guys. Just found out about this community. I just wanted to say that it is possible to make it out and get to a position in life where you are much happier.

Several years ago, because of some experiences I was going through, I was depressed, overweight, a social recluse, and someone that just didn't belong in society. I had absolutely zero friends, and during my high school years, I would go home from school and immediately self-isolate myself. I lacked a viable support system so it was just me swimming alone in all my thoughts.

Today, I've been diagnosed with OCD, anxiety, and ADHD. Through my efforts alone, I'm proud to say that I've gotten myself out of the rut I was in. I have a good social life, and I've made considerable progress forward, addressing my own internal issues and my mental health problems. I've even made a youtube channel at aidansperspective addressing mental health and how you can take small steps to improve it within yourself. Though I am not perfectly content with the position I am currently in, I can say I am much happier both with myself and my circumstances. In no way is it fair that you have to go through these things and overcome what others don't even think about. I want to say that. But you still have to do it. It's okay to fail. And it's okay to mess up. Don't worry about the past and understand it has no bearing on what you do going forward. Accept yourself and know it's okay to move forward. You can do it. Trust in yourself, give yourself some grace, and just take one step forward at a time. I will be the first to tell you that YOU ARE ENOUGH. You got this.

I want to be good for my family but I just fail so massively everywhere I put in effort. 

I do a job a or college? I choose college. A job sou is like hell for my fragile mental health and I hate masking all the time.
A hurricane hits my town, ruins any good streak I had with college. I try to get back in it. My cat dies and I am left in a hell up speakable and have to drop out.
I drop out and suddenly none of my tuition was covered and now I owe 2,000 dollars that is still not getting resolved no matter my tuition appeal.

So okay that didn't work lets try doing a job interview. I get my best friend to go and it went great. 
I dont get a call back til two weeks later but by then I feel like hell hit home again and my best friend decides me not friends with her boyfriend isn't going to work and is no longer my friend.

Then I attempt SNHU, isn't working cause the classes are too little and my patents want me out of the house and to get a job.

They are constantly pushing. I know I'm 20 but I'm so burn out emotionally. I can't think most days without feeling like I'm poisoning my brain. I'm talking meds but this one isn't working well rn.

1m65ngc,My parents make me feel like I'm not allowed to exist as a mentally ill person,"I know that this isn't their intention, but it still hurts. For context, I am 19M living with multiple mental illnesses, both diagnosed and undiagnosed.

Lately, I've been really struggling with some new-ish symptoms, and its lead me into depression and brought back my OCD symptoms in full-force.

I really just wanted someone to vent to today, so I went to my mom. Instead of support, I got the usual. Her immediate attempts to dismiss my struggles as nothing, making me feel invalid and hurt in the process. Every time I bring up that I'm struggling, she tells me that I'm probably ""just tired"", ""just hungry"", or that its a ""normal"" thing that people go through sometimes and I'm blowing it out of proportion. My dad is kind of the same, but in a different way. It's so frustrating because if it was something that freaking simple, I would've fixed the issue ages ago!

I know they're probably just trying to help, but it feels dismissive and makes me not want to talk to them about anything vulnerable. It makes me feel like maybe I really am just making up or exaggerating my symptoms. And it makes me feel like I'm not allowed to exist around them as a human being with mental health struggles.

I've made it clear to them that I'm not looking for advice or suggestions. All I want is to have someone acknowledge my struggle, acknowledge that it sucks, and maybe give me a hug. I don't want someone to tell me everything that it could or couldn't be, because chances are, I've already gone through the whole list and tried to fix the simple ones. I don't really have anyone else I could talk too, either. I only have one close friend and they haven't been answering my messages. I have a therapist, but I only see her once a week and today was that day, so I have to wait another week.

1m65gda,How to destroy sex drive and stop having romantic/sexual thoughts?,"Over the past couple of years, I’ve gotten addicted to porn and it’s gotten so bad that I jerk off once everyday and sometimes even twice. Hell sometimes thrice but very rarely. I keep thinking I have a “high sex drive” but that’s realistically only a result of my porn addiction rather than actually having a high sex drive. Sexual thoughts and desire are such a fucking waste of time. I no longer want to be preoccupied with such thoughts and feelings. They are a hinderance. Life would be so much better if I was aromantic and/or asexual. 

I find myself maladaptive dreaming far too much about cuddling and kissing a girl and that combined with masturbation is a bunch of waste of time. I also suck as person. I’m pretty boring and god awful at conversations. I have few hobbies like reading, watching media (I don’t count this as a hobby but I’m throwing it out there) and that’s kind of it. I recently joined this outdoors club at my college and went hiking for the first time ever and loved it, so I guess I like hiking too. Covid hit my social skills tanked and didn’t interact with anyone in HS so I’ve dug myself in a very deep hole. All in all, I’m kind of a fucking waste. 

I’m also only 5’1 at 19 so I know love’s not gonna find me. I’ve been going to the gym and lost weight and now I’m not really overweight anymore but it all seems so pointless. What’s the point of working out and getting better social skills if I’ll be discarded like trash by every girl for something I didn’t choose and can’t even change? I want to stop having sexual urges so I wanted to chemically castrate myself but probably not this young as it’ll probably fuck up my hormones. I’ve been masturbating way more recently due to being summer meaning no school and apparently if you masturbate enough your sex drive will eventually go down but it isn’t fucking working… so I’m switching tactics. Do you guys know any over-the-counter drugs that lower libido? Any over-the-counter SSRI’s?

That sucks he struggled so much. Or some band member that is loved saying his mind is like a bad neighborhood, but smiles. You don’t have to be famous to live that life. These people are loving human beings.

People focus too much on what’s different like people don’t have feelings. Regardless how confident people try to come off, it’s preferable by the world and it’s not for themselves it’s for the world. It’s those that struggle that get repeatedly taken advantage of and yet they try to remain positive even in the face of complete decades of responsibility lost. 

It’s easy to point from the sidelines and say this is the reason, or that is the reason. You need this in your life, or you don’t need that in your life. I want this for you, but I’m not you. You’re not me. They’re theories, you can be sure has been tried. I’m not ashamed of my struggles, because you learn to forgive yourself. To go with what works when trying new things isn’t fruitful, but you know you’ll try again. To try, but don’t beat yourself up if you fall back. 

The only currency in that life is knowing you’ll have good days or bad days, good seasons and bad seasons. To cope you try to find the humor in things. The good with the bad so the bad doesn’t become overwhelming. The truth is, it does make you appreciate. Everything. You’ve known for a long time tomorrow is promised to no one. 

I think the world needs to be more aware of or at least have more compassion for people who say they struggle. It takes a lot to say so. Often as a joke. Just because someone isn’t bouncing with joy doesn’t mean they’re not happy with their life. It only takes one to steal your joy when it presents enough times to know there isn’t enough understanding to keep them above water. If every spark is returned with criticism, as aware-making as it’s meant to be, the sparks become fewer and farther between.

Sometimes it’s not necessarily about needing positive feedback as externally validating, as negative feedback suffocating one’s shine when they need that moment of confidence. People can have whatever theories they’d like. They’re welcome to have them for people who do absolutely nothing but vices and need saving. People aren’t psychiatrists. 

Just know for those that have their battles, I see you. The world is rough, and surviving while not feeling bad about yourself can be quite the win, even if it’s not understood or considered ideal. Steady can be joy. It’s the joy I’ve appreciated. The world is great. People are awesome. Don’t let them get you down even if you’re your own cheerleader when you need it. If you’re that person, I see you, I feel you, and I’m cheering for you as well. You’re not broken, you’re a survivor, to even that which is never presented to the world.",1,0,1753157684.0,mentalhealth,Struglin_Salmon_1361,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m64gdq/the_world_is_rough_but_you_are_enough/,2025-07-25T09:58:22.232626

1m64bf3,Feeling down trodden 21 M,"So i want to give some context. I recently exited a relationship, it wasnt a bad end but a mutual agreement i guess. I think i broke it off because of my needy behavior i realized it was getting to be too much so i knew i had to leave. That was about 2 weeks ago now, i have been doing ok but today i have felt super down trodden. Ive been going back to old habits while also progressing with new ones. Ie i quit smoking weed every night around October 2024 and now in july have started smoking every night again which has really began negatively effecting me. Its not as if i quit everything i would drink pretty much every night in replacement of weed. Besides that i have been looking to find new people in the dating market, get back out there if you will. Its been sort of hard as i have low self esteem sometimes and low confidence aswell sometimes, it fluctuates some days ill feel like the man other times i will feel like a meek child.  Its really hard sometimes i get such strong feelings of inferiority. I have been talking to some people but i cant really get out with my jobs hours. It really bugs me sometimes i feel unwanted, i guess that is at the core of this all. I have done some bad things in the past they still get to me. These feelings get amplified when i dont receive a text message back from someone im interested in or even just friends. The voices keep getting amplified when im unsuccessful at attracting someone whom i find attractive and i begin to spiral thinking horrid things about myself even though i am not the person i was and the mistakes i made are ones i will never repeat. Just looking for some support or someone to talk to really. Thanks for your time.

1m64afv,Why does my sister act like this towards me?.,"We were playfully running around the house I was chasing her and I don't remember what I said but it led to her saying at least my boobs are perky unlike yours that are saggy and burnt (I had a really bad sunburn at the time) that no one likes. 
One time my mom was making cookies and I asked if I could help and my sister's like you don't want to actually help you just want to eat the cookie dough like always and I said no I just actually want to help she was like yeah sure. After the cookies were made I physically couldn't eat them I was going to throw up I told my mom and she made my sister apologize my sister was like just so you know I'm worse. 

No you're not.

She used to abuse me physically and emotionally she did it to take out the anger she had from her abuser she would punch me, pull my hair, kick me until I had bruises everywhere. she blackmailed me into doing her school work. She's younger than me so I feel pathetic. 
She said I was annoying. 
And I've talked to her about it and she said I did the same thing to her which is not true I never did that to her. Yes I was kind of a bully to her in elementary school (I would ignore her and tell my friend she was annoying, and I regret it with everything in my body) but I apologized for that and she forgave me but she will use it against me in arguments.

I raised her when my dad was a deadbeat and my mom was trying to work and provide for us. I was 1 about to turn 2 and she was just a newborn. 
I tried my best but I was just a kid myself I didn't know what I was doing.

One time while we were swimming my nail accidentally hit her arm and I didn't mean to and I apologize and she told me ""get away from you right now I have instant anger I will hit you get away from me"" I kept apologizing but she kept telling me to shut up because she was very close to hitting me back. My fingernail barely grazed her arm.

1m6487r,"am I schizophrenic, autistic or just misunderstood?","context: 20m, fresh out of my first hospitalization after a panic attack went extreme. My thing is, I've always known I'm a bad teacher, can't deal with kids, dogs, loud noises; I've assumed it's just because I'm very introverted. Recently moved to a big city, found a partner. I have dealt with my emotional states before, and it has never before gotten so out of my control.

During my stay in the psych ward (got manhandled by staff, yelled at a lot, physically restrained, sedated), I've developed completely new and different problems and symptoms. I started to feel afraid of people around me, losing control of my bladder, having constant anxiety and headaches. I also started to feel completely detached from my partner, completely lost my libido too. I feel permanently gross and unworthy, I'm getting told I'm being mean to everyone around me.
meanwhile I feel like my needs aren't getting met and the constant noise is just so overwhelming.

1m5zgg6,Where Im at,"I do not know what I am hoping to achieve by posting this. It might sound like incessant rambling and ranting but I assure you, this is at least somewhat thought out. Screaming into the void I guess. Hoping it answers.

Anyways. I am a 21 year old man. I live with my parents. I have no college or trade education. I am recently laid off of work because I broke my hand. Not that the work is anything worthwhile anyways, just a shop job.

I have borderline personality disorder, anxiety, depression, ""obsessive compulsive tendencies"" (idek what that means to be honest with you), ptsd and insomnia. 

I tried to end my life twice. Both times when I was 14. I haven't since then but it always lingers somewhere in the back of my mind. I dissociate on a daily basis. Sometimes very bad episodes. Intense mood swings are a daily part of life. So intense I can feel them coming, like a head feeling almost. Like a buzz from nicotine or something. And they can happen in seconds, for basically ANY reason. Thats unfortunately what I understand to be the borderline condition. I am insanely co-dependent. I have no sense of self, what I want, who is ""____"", that kinda thing.

My physical health is in ruins as well. I have quite a few diseases related to my immune system. Mainly eosoniphils (if thats relevant to you) that cause the issues. I have no hair, alopecia totalis. My gallbladder got removed at 16. Eczema, asthma, eosoniphilic esophagitis (my immune system is attacking my stomach and throat). No lie, i have an allergy to the cold (cold urticaria). Theres more but yk, etc...

I believe my diseases and disorders, both mental and physical were caused my a medication I took at a young age. It caused me my first mental health crysis and I have never been the same since. I tried to start a lawsuit in order to get some kind of compensation for whats happened in my life but no dice. 

My borderline however, unlike the other conditions, i believe was inevitable. My father shows many of the symptoms of borderline. He was verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive growing up. He was an addict. Very unstable. Did not know how much it affected me growing up.

Unfortunately, the older I get the more I realize I am turning into my father. Much like him, my relationships don't last, usually me being cited as the source. Which I won't deny but idk... I dont like that idea. Both romantic and platonic by the way. My friends are all currently growing very distant from me. My mom was always my biggest supporter but for the past couple years its almost like shes growing.... tired? Like i have been such an emotional and financial burden that the cracks are starting to show. And I'm single (if you couldn't tell).

And as for the addict part, I dont have a huge history with drugs but I certainly am an addict. I was self medicating with weed for a long time. Got to a point where I was smoking about a cart a day roughly. And nicotine has been a huge factor for a while. I ran out recently and I was out of nicotine for roughly 16 hours. I was shaking uncontrollably, I had a fever spike up to 102 and I couldnt think about anything. But I got my hands on some cigarettes, and here we are again. Oh and now alcohol is a factor. If i can get my hands on it, that means I am getting blackout and probably crying the whole night.

Much more I could say, but 3500 text limit. Thats most of it. Let me know what ya think folks. Lets hear it",2,1,1753143059.0,mentalhealth,Former_Bathroom1568,False,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1m5zgg6/where_im_at/,2025-07-25T09:58:22.232626

1m5tl9p,Is this it? Is this life?,"I feel so defeated. I'm about four years into the ol' Monday to Friday 9-5 and I just can't take it any more. 

It's maddening. The small talk and empty platitudes in team group chats. Vapid, empty messages from senior management promising they give a hoot about the business progressing. The people with demonstrably no skill somehow becoming department directors and earning 6-figure salaries compared to the genuinely hard-working regular staff working ourselves to death for a pittance. Corporate jargon. 

And I know that even if I leave my current job, it'll all be the same somewhere else. All I want out of life is enough time to do do the things I like. Instead I have no energy by the time I finish work to enjoy myself, let alone look for another job. 

I asked someone for advice the other day, and their wise input was 'find the positives, choose to be happy, and learn to deal with it'. So that's it? I've just got to accept that's my lot in life - work myself to the point of depression and just power through?

I'm so done but I don't see a way out. Recent life events mean I have no savings, so I can't just quit and then look for work while living off my emergency fund. So I'm trapped in a working situation that's giving me regular anxiety attacks, but if I leave that I won't be able to afford to live.

1m5thbr,ADHD? or am I just a lazy terrible person?,"Hi everyone,

I’m 18 and I’ve been struggling with so many things lately that I don’t know if it’s just me being lazy or if I actually have something like ADHD. It’s really hard for me to do even the simplest tasks—like closing doors, putting lids back on bottles, or cleaning my room—and my parents get really annoyed with me because of it. They say I’m lazy and don’t try hard enough, but I honestly feel like I’m stuck in my own head and can’t get myself to start or finish anything unless it’s something I find really interesting.

I put off everything all the time, and that makes me feel terrible about myself. I forget where I put things just minutes after, like my phone or makeup, and I miss appointments, work shifts, and school deadlines. I procrastinate so much that I sometimes skip assignments or revision completely because I feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to begin.

Socially, I’ve always struggled. I have no friends right now, and I’ve lost the few I had because I make impulsive decisions—like choosing to spend time with my boyfriend instead of them—and it’s caused friendships to end. When I’m with people I trust, I talk a lot about what I’m interested in and sometimes repeat myself. But most of the time, I’m quiet and anxious, worrying about how I sound or how people see me. I rehearse conversations in my head over and over, even if they probably won’t happen. I also switch topics quickly in conversations, jumping from one thing to another, which I think makes it hard for others to follow.

I can’t sit still at all—I’m always bouncing my leg or fidgeting to try and manage how overwhelmed I feel. I make impulsive decisions without thinking about the consequences, and when it all gets too much, I sometimes self-harm. I get really focused on things for short periods—like when I was obsessed with learning to drive and did loads of theory tests—but then I lose interest and need something new to focus on.

I’ve also struggled with addiction, especially alcohol, because it’s the only time I feel normal, productive, and social—like how I imagine other people’s everyday lives are.

I’ve always found subjects like maths and English really difficult, even though I’m good at sports. My family doesn’t really believe that these problems are real and just says I’m lazy or going through a phase. But I feel like something deeper is wrong, and I’m really overwhelmed by it all. I’ve recently started having suicidal thoughts because I genuinely can’t keep living like this.

I’m not sure if I actually have ADHD or if I’m just an incompetent person who can’t keep up. Has anyone else felt like this? How do you tell the difference? Any advice on what I should do or how to get help would mean so much.

Thank you for reading.
